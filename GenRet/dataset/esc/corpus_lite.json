Are you very close?"], ["Well I think that it might be a very good idea if she could approach the rest of your family and maybe even your therapist on your behalf?"], ["Well, your therapist is not, in my mind, as important as  your family.

That is a really unpleasant thing to do to someone, especially at this time of year."], ["Is there anyone close to you that you can talk to about this? Friends?"], ["Yes it is a very cowardly thing to do. I am quite disgusted that she did not have the courage to talk to you face to face too.

I can tell how upset you feel just from talking to you, and also that the method of the break up is  really sore point."], ["It could be that you are better off without her?

So I know it can be rough"], ["Well have you thought of any next steps to take?  From what I have seen, it is easier to start looking for a new job before you need to leave the old one.  Maybe you could start job searching sooner rather than later?  I might have some contacts that can help"], ["Awesome! Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you in these tough times.  It can be useful to take some time to relax too :) Maybe eat a favorite food or talk with a friend or go on a long walk to destress :)"], ["Awesome, meditation can always help make complex problems feel a bit simpler.

I learned a lot of coping strategies. I can share a few of those with you if you want."], ["One of the best ways is to take a walk. Get outside, get fresh air. Look at the sky and the clouds and the trees and the grass. This will not only physically refresh you but help your health as well."], ["As for the pandemic, if you know no one who has died, I wouldn't worry about it. The CDC has no reported deaths of anyone healthy. People who are unhealthy die, not the healthy, and people who are sick ALREADY are the ones who die.

Focusing on the negative will depress you."], ["One thing I did to help with depression is keep a checklist of things to do when I felt down:  call a friend, call a loved one to encourage THEM, go for a walk, eat fruits and veggies, read a book, go for a bike ride, etc.  Things like that, then I chose to do those things despite how I felt. Doing those things helped my mood TREMENDOUSLY>"], ["Feelings follow thoughts. If you think negative thoughts, you will feel negative. If you think positive thoughts, you will feel positive.

I think many people are affected. And I encourage you to really do things you like and enjoy to keep your mood better.

I do thank you for sharing your life with me. I'm an older person and this has affected me too.  Life is full of ups and downs, so I've been through some rough times. You can do this! :D"], ["I had one more thought about when the ambulance comes by and you get upset. Pray for the person, pray for the workers. They are the ones who CAN do something about the sick people. You cannot. You didn't become an ambulance worker. I am not an ambulance worker, I cannot help them either, but I can pray God can help them do their job. Then I let it go."], ["I cannot worry about what is not my job. I have a home and family to care for and pets and neighbors.  So this is what I can do, I cannot fix the sick so the ambulance workers do their job, I do mine.

I am sorry to hear that though - I know how much it hurts when you split with someone, especially if it was not consensual."], ["It's a lousy time of year for it too, isn't it?"], ["That is a defeatist way to talk! Just because a couple of relationships fail does not mean that you will never be able to find happiness."], ["I have been in that position too. I hate it when I realise that I am not being rational but I can't seem to stop myself sometimes and this has sometimes let to problems with my inter personal relationships"], ["I hear you on that one too! It's horrible to feel that you are losing your self respect but I suspect that we've all done it at some point. Have you considered getting some counselling?"], ["I hear  you saying that they are not really effective, is that true?"], ["Okay .. I hope you reported him!!"], ["I understand that as well .. I am on medication for it. A dog is a wonderful thing to have! Do you feel that it has helped you?"], ["Dogs are very very loyal.

I would prefer to work out a situation rather than use divorce as an option as well, but I am concerned with how miserable you have become."], ["Some people respond to different strategies. You have tried communication through words to tell your husband your feelings, but have you shown him the consequences of his actions? Does he see how miserable you are? I suppose I wonder if you are interested in utilizing different strategies to find a solution to your issues with your husband and any others who may treat you badly."], ["Alright. I have enjoyed talking to you, and hope that things will work out for you. My last suggestion is possibly to try to talk your husband into couple's therapy and see how he responds. Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again. In situations like this, remember even when you feel completely alone, that someone is looking out for you even if you do not realize it.

I've tried therapy myself and was very hesitant at first. But after a while I found it really did help"], ["Do you feel ready to tell me what specifically is wrong?"], ["Well, let's take these one at a time. Firstly, is there something you could do to make friends? Join a group of some kind?"], ["What about something like a book club or a gym?"], ["You never know, you might also find a date there :)"], ["No you are not. Thinking like that is a symptom of depression. It is perfectly normal but there is help available."], ["I do understand. I have suffered severe depression and I know how debilitating it is. Can you see your doctor?"], ["Would you be prepared to take medication? I know a lot of people hate the idea but it can really help."], ["I was talking about anti depressants :). I use prozac and it helps a lot."], ["Yes - it is an anti depressant drug that was developed about thirty years ago. It works by preventing your brain from reuptaking serotonin"], ["Serotonin actually makes you feel good. In a  depressed person it can be reuptaken by the brain too rapidly however, leaving you feeling low. Prozac prevents this from happening."], ["I hope I have been able to help you. Enjoy your day!"], ["Just click the button at the bottom :)"], ["Hi, how are you doing?"], ["It sounds like it would be quite frustrating for your friend to talk way too much on the phone."], ["My goodness! How do they respond when you ask to end the conversation?"], ["I wonder what it would be like for him if you hung up the phone even after he said he still wanted to talk."], ["Wow--that does sound annoying that he will repeat the same pattern the next time."], ["That sounds really difficult if he gets offended so easily. I find it hard to talk to some of those kinds of friends."], ["What do you get out of the friendship with this other person?"], ["That sounds like a lot that the two of you have been through. Were there other times that your friends was more equally responsive or attuned to you in conversations?"], ["I wonder if there is anything nice you could do for yourself when you are talking to him that would make it easier to talk to him."], ["I can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable."], ["Would it hurt his feelings to use a timer like that? It may for some other people."], ["Humor is really helpful for a lot of people."], ["Sometimes, people draw or do something else distracting with their hands when talking to someone who dominates the conversation."], ["Sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. And, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded."], ["The strategy works well for me with some of my family members who seem like they will never change. But, with distraction, I enjoy them all the more."], ["Is there anything else that you like to do that would be distracting while also letting you somewhat participate in the conversation?"], ["That sounds really helpful. Sometimes people also play phone games or with a fidget spinner. I like your idea of looking on the internet."], ["You are very welcome. I wish you all the best!"], ["Bye!"], ["Hello! How are you doing today?"], ["That's great, especially around this time of the Holidays."], ["So, how are things in your life?"], ["I'm very sorry to hear that. Not being able to be with family when something like that happens is incredibly difficult, those are the people you want to be around the most."], ["I actually had a death in a family a few months ago as well, with a virtual funeral. I really empathize with the way you and your family are feeling. But you know, I tried to look at the virtual funeral as a way for so many people to pay tribute in a way they couldn't in person. People from all over ge\nt their chance to say goodbye."], ["Truly, everyone got to participate and pay tribute together. Virtually or not, you were all together."], ["That's a great way to look at it. In a year where COVID had gotten in the way of so many plans, I think it's really great to try and extract the best experience we can."], ["Exactly, trying to be safe together to keep everyone else safe. Looking out for one another is something this year has made really important."], ["I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you dealing with that loss?"], ["I'm glad to hear you're doing alright. The lack of human connection and socialization this past year has definitely been very difficult."], ["Absolutely no problem, getting your thoughts out and talking things out helps me so I'm glad I could help you."], ["I'm very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder."], ["What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin?"], ["I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular?"], ["It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them."], ["I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all?"], ["Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide."], ["What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better?"], ["I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this?"], ["That's great! \nWhat ways do you think you could communicate more with your family?"], ["You listed a lot of good solutions such as zoom and texting. Do you think doing that would make you feel less depressed?"], ["Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off-hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods?"], ["Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that?"], ["Well, it's worth a try, right!"], ["Thank you for allowing us to complete this task as well. I know depression can cause us to lose motivation, so I really appreciate it. I hope you feel better."], ["You are welcome. Goodbye."], ["ok. How can I be of service tonight"], ["Tell me more please I am all ears"], ["When did this happen, How long ago"], ["So you had been together for awhile and all of \n a sudden he has another person in his life"], ["Was this guy an associate of yours as well"], ["So basically this guy was a stranger that you know of."], ["Did you have any children between you"], ["DiId your partner work also"], ["Maybe the time on his hands enabled to him meet someone while you were working. Did he have a following that you knew of"], ["has there been habits like this before"], ["His actions none the less are not right"], ["Do you have an idea his websites"], ["The fact that he cheated on you and I assume you broke up with him is hard"], ["He must have a special account that people can access to, can you possibly find it out"], ["Maybe you need to focus on you now, and plan your days ahead."], ["Had you known before hand it might be of help, but the sudden impact does not make it any better"], ["if you look back you will have regrets.

Have a blessed night."], ["Hello how are you doing today?"], ["I am doing good, is there anything you would like to talk about?"], ["I am so sorry. I understand it must be hard to deal with I myself have a daughter. Did you press charges?"], ["That must be awful for her as well as you, I feel that sometimes the victims are left in the shadows when it comes to sexual assault."], ["How is your daughter doing now?"], ["That's true alot of people dont come forward with sexual assault due to being not believed."], ["She was very brave, and is a role model for others!"], ["Yes friends are very helpful, Im glad she had that."], ["Therapy can be a great thing especially if you find that one therapist you feel comfortable with. It always helps to talk about things."], ["No problem, have a great day!"], ["Hi, I can't see the upper box that you can see, so what brings you \nto seek support?"], ["I'm sorry, I cannot. Sadly, the program is bad."], ["You will have to restate your concerns."], ["I'm so sorry. I'm sure that would be very upsetting, and very concerning for your future. That sounds awful!"], ["Okay, so it sounds like you cannot pay the bills, you are looking for a job, and the economic situation is tough right now due to the pandemic. This is your main concern for the conversation, then? To discuss how to secure another job?"], ["Have you consulted with a job center, a life coach, or any other resource such as online websites? These may be useful."], ["I am sure you will be able to get a new job if you have the commitment. Maybe you can tell me a little more about what type of job you are looking for?"], ["Okay, that sounds like a great start. Many jobs have moved to being remote, so I can see that as a great alternative. I know there are many covid tracing jobs by phone that pay well. Have you searched for those on any online websites? Would that interest you?"], ["Wow, that is terrific! I know those are in high-demand right now, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did call you back. Your experience will definitely make you more marketable as well."], ["Have you had anyone look at your resume to see if improvements could be made while you wait?"], ["Okay, that's great. Today, many resumes are not screened by humans, but by computers, analyzing for key words, first."], ["You are welcome. I hope you don't give up, and stay optimistic! It sounds like you have a great start."], ["I know sometime it's really frustrating.

Time and money are sometime the big constraints but we should keep trying."], ["It is always hard to find true friends. You must be a strong person and I know you can achieve anything."], ["Believe in yourself and don't give up. Definitely some solution will be around."], ["I am really sorry to hear about that. I also got laid off and was worried, then I start searching online work. Found it and doing it now. Hope it will work for you too."], ["At this tough time we need to stay motivated and keep trying."], ["I really like talking to you, hope it will help you in staying positive."], ["There is no harm in taking doctors advice. Sorry to here about that. you can try online counselling. there are so many website offering free counselling sessions. you can search on google"], ["I would suggest follow your routine, stay motivated and keep looking to for the new place. Sometime sitting with the partner and having conversation with the person might help."], ["Have you ever tried to quit this habit or had counselling before?"], ["That might be the reason.  It is not impossible to quit it. you just need bit guidance."], ["I can understand is is not that easy. Time is really tough right now. We as human being nothing is impossible for us to do. Problem like  drugs can be quitted if we stay strong and determined.  It is hard to say that drugs can not make us normal."], ["I can understand your situation.

Inevitably, they wanted to do what was right for the employees."], ["The power dynamics make it more challenging to be as open as we would like to be, right?"], ["Yes.

What will happen if you leave your home?"], ["Do you have a lot of friends how were healthy that died?"], ["I have found that being in isolation lowers my immunity, and if I want to be healthy, fresh air, loving friends, exercise, good healthy food is the way to do it, not isolation and loneliness. That affect me emotionally and I don't want to despair, that makes me feel terrible. It doesn't feel healthy, and we know no one that has died either.

I see no evidence of a pandemic nor do my nurse friends. So we live our lives normally. But some are afraid, and fear takes its toll on people. I say use your eyes, look around, if there aren't people dying all around you and you aren't hearing of a lot of people dying in ten months of this, there probably aren't a lot of people dying. And life is short.

It really helped a lot."], ["Thank you for your kind words!  You should invite your friends. I don't think living in fear is actually living.

They can be very painful, how long were you together?"], ["It's very sad and your emotions will take a toll, but you have to set some goals so you don't fall into a funk.

I'm older, been through a LOT of hard knocks. You will be stronger too, right now you are hurting, in time you will see more clearly."], ["He hasn't told you why, so the problem lies in him, not you. So do your best not to be hard on yourself. It is a shock to you now, but he never even communicated this with you over time, and he should have. that's what you want in a partner."], ["If a relationship has problems, you want someone to talk about he problems and work on them and grow as two people. He chose to walk away, that's immature and not what you want in a relationship. That is actually abusive."], ["Thank you! You are so very kind! And you are very sweet too, willing to hear the truth! That is an admirable quality!  You deserve a partner willing to work on problems, not a quitter."], ["Do take care of yourself! Find some friends, work hard at that, call old friends too. Just to say hi, call an old aunt or uncle and check in. Find community. That will help you."], ["Yes! Don't hop into another relationship for a long time, months, even a year. Find out who you are.

How are you this evening?"], ["Sorry to hear that. How long have you been in a slump?"], ["I can understand that. It's been hard on a lot of people. Sometimes marriages need a bit of help during tough times, have you considered a counselor?"], ["My husband and I have gone a few times and it really helped having an objective person give us a few tips. We learned a lot even in just a few short months. We set goals, achieved them and then years passed and went again."], ["That's too bad that he won't go again. I would still go for yourself. I have gone by myself because I needed extra help.  And it's hard to deal with someone who doesn't want to grow and change."], ["I had an auto immune disorder too, actually, the counseling helped that a lot. Emotions have a way of wreaking havoc on our bodies.

Do you have any goals set?"], ["It sounds like you have a full plate with the little one. I know a lot of people are fearful now, but rest assured, children are really resilient to disease. The CDC has not even one record of a healthy child dying. Can you still go to the park and let them run and play? I think it's healthier to be around people then to isolate. That's my personal observation. It's really taking a toll on all of us emotionally to be distant."], ["little ones . . ."], ["One thing that comes to mind about your marriage is how I continued to work on myself, and surprisingly, some of the changes I made in myself helped my husband change. For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time.  So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain."], ["I would encourage you to write out some goals and things you want to change about yourself, ideas for you and your children to do. And fight the blues as hard as you can.

I'm like a granma to you! hahaha I'm almost 60. We need people in our lives, older, younger, all ages. We all learn from each other. Perhaps call and aunt and check in with them. Sometimes it makes us feel better to reach out and encourage others."], ["As for your son and homeschooling, I'm sure you are challenged but think of this as a great opportunity. Perhaps teach him to cook? Make games up that are learning games about how to care for a home, perhaps repair things, all kinds of ideas. Perhaps have him test you on things."], ["I'm glad I could encourage you. You sound very intelligent and caring. Marriage is hard work, so is motherhood, but it can be rewarding and fulfilling. Sometimes we lose track of that and we need ideas to perk us up again and help us remember our goals."], ["I am so sorry for hearing that. Do you want to talk more detail about that?"], ["You seem really focus on just one person. Life is rich. Think about other important people in your life such as parents, friends"], ["Yes of course you should take your time as long as you want and you can do it, one day you can leave all those problem"], ["Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you'll try them out"], ["Just chatting with you, you seem very a smart, strong girl.

Btw, it helps for your current mood, does not it? I mean we are talking about other stuffs which make you think about your problem less?"], ["How are you this evening?"], ["I am doing well, I am sorry to hear you are feeling sad."], ["What is bothering you tonight?"], ["So, just to clarify, you are going through a hard divorce with your ex-wife and this has you feeling very down.."], ["Sorry about that, ex-husband."], ["I can definitely tell this is making you feel very anxious and sad from the few messages we have exchanged."], ["I recently went through a hard break up with an ex-fianc\u00e9 who got pregnant from another man, so I know how difficult a situation like this can be,"], ["Have you had a conversation with him with some sort of objective third party to try and work through the differences in seeing your children?

I am glad you reached out tonight!"], ["You as well!"], ["Good night!"], ["No problem, how are you tonight?"], ["Just to make sure I understand, you recently left a job and you are feeling very anxious about it."], ["What caused you to leave the job?"], ["I completely understand that reasoning. I was also very anxious when the pandemic first started due to working in a grocery store."], ["Did they offer you any type of leave due to COVID?"], ["I understand, I can tell through typing with you that this has made you very anxious."], ["Did you get any contact information from the employees you worked with while you were there?

There are a lot of companies who are offering remote work during this time."], ["It was my pleasure!"], ["Yes it is!"], ["School will definitely help."], ["Routines are definitely\n helpful, I make sure to spend plenty of time doing other hobbies I enjoy to take my mind off of the pandemic."], ["I find myself watching a lot of movies and tv shows I enjoy as well as playing video games."], ["I have done the same."], ["It was not a problem!

I am here to chat :) What is on your mind?"], ["I'm so sorry to hear that, that is really rough. He sounds like a real jerk if you ask me!"], ["I get that, it's hard to understand why the people close to us do bad things."], ["You did nothing wrong. It's something wrong with him, if he did this to you, he'll probably do it again to her.

And it's not a walk in the park to get over someone when you've been so close to them. Breakups are kind of like a bad cut. They really hurt for a bit, but then a scar eventually forms over it and you start to forget about it."], ["Do you have a group of friends, or activities to keep you busy while you're going through this? It helps to keep your mind distracted :)"], ["And you are so welcome! I've been through my share of breakups too, it's never fun!"], ["Friends come and they go, it doesn't have to be a game of choosing sides. Keep in touch with those that keep in touch with you.

Have you considered asking your doctor?"], ["I am not totally sure what is available but I think that there might be such things"], ["Well no, I don't think that all men are like this by any stretch of the imagination.

Do you ever meet with them in any capacity?"], ["It's been the same way at my school. At least there is some solace in knowing that a large group of students is also struggling right now.

I have confidence that you, and this entire country, is going to get through these difficult times."], ["I definitely get that. It's especially hard because we've had to sit still for so long. It's almost been a year since things were normal. It's kind of like we're just waiting for real life to start again."], ["That sounds incredible.

Rather than hiding the sadness or grieving feelings, some people find relief in acknowledging and sharing these feelings with family members who may relate. Do you ever share these feelings with your cousin or grandparents that you mentioned?"], ["I understand. When losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives."], ["Are there any aspects of the holidays that bring you joy? Maybe holiday music, movies, bright snow (if there is snow where you live), or seeing joy on someone's face when you give them a great gift?"], ["I understand - and it is normal to feel that way. When we lose someone who brought us happiness, it is only natural to miss them and their company."], ["That's great! You must have a special talent for personalizing your gift selections. Perhaps focus on that reaction from you nieces and nephews to support your motivation for giving gifts this year."], ["Wow, what a great gift idea! That is a solid start on your gifts for the season, and something to be proud of."], ["And I see, it sounds like the changes in your life are potentially impacting your daughter as well.

Good thinking!"], ["I am sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it?"], ["Oh I am so sorry to hear that. I cannot imagine how hard that must have been for you."], ["He was killed so soon after you last saw him?"], ["Have you considered any sort of bereavement counselling?

What he did was bad though, no denying that."], ["Maybe he feels ashamed about watching porn, that's why he tried to hide. I would hate it too if my partner watches porn"], ["Other than that, is there anything else?"], ["I think you should be firm, let him know how much you hate what he did and how much it affected you. I think it's a serious issue, him not being honest with you over trivial things. At the same time, breaking up  without any other issues is kind of not optimal considered you;ve dated for 1 year"], ["Did you see any changes in behavior after that?"], ["you should tell him that, and let him the problem is you feel disrespected when he watches porn while dating you"], ["I am so sorry to hear that, you are not oversensitive at all. Trust me, any normal girls would feel the same"], ["Breaking up over this is a pity, however, he doesn't seem trustworthy after everything you told me.

I have been in a similar situation and I really think that it is best that you move on from this.

Have you been worrying about anything?"], ["Do you work in academia then? Or are you a student?"], ["So you feel that life was more simple when you were still in high school?"], ["I think that it is quite usual to feel a bit disorientated when transitioning from school to college. It is strange to feel like an adult all of a sudden"], ["Yes I do. It took me quite a long time to adjust to college in my first year too."], ["It was a bit but I think that it was not just me. It's a huge life change. Is your problem mainly with your grades or are there other issues?"], ["Do you feel scared that you might fail your exams?"], ["There are personal tutors available who could help you with any academic problems you are having?"], ["There is no need to feel ashamed that you are not doing as well as you hoped"], ["hello, how can I help you?"], ["How long have you known you have depression?"], ["Because of Covid?

You did the right and responsible thing for refusing to visit them."], ["May I ask how old your children are?"], ["they might have been scared because of external forces, as in they might see you being stressed out.

I have been through something like this myself in the past so I do understand."], ["I think it was at least a year before I felt truly myself again and that I was able to enjoy life"], ["I can tell that it's all very raw to you at the moment. You really need to step away and give yourself some time to heal"], ["What sort of obligations do you feel that you have? You need to be kind to yourself at the moment"], ["It is good of you to be so caring and responsible towards your family. Do you think that perhaps you are taking too much on yourself though, especially at such a difficult time?"], ["I think that that is an excellent idea and that you are being very mature about this."], ["Are you in contact with your ex at all?"], ["That seems sensible. I had a problem with not contacting my ex when we split. I kept wanting to talk to him again even though I knew that I should not"], ["A restraining order :D"], ["In all seriousness though, with hindsight I realise that our separation was for the best.

One thing I did was take a salsa class .. that was a great way to meet new people"], ["There are lots of other things you could do.

Or maybe take time to communicate more with your friends?"], ["Well i dont know when this is going to end but if we let this isolation win the we are going to get worse.

It can sometimes take up to 5 months according to data."], ["Ahh that is indeed frustrating. Do you have any friends or family that may serve as a reference for you?"], ["Depending on people is not a sign of weakness so don't hesitate ask for help. Connections unfortunately lead to many opportunities in life."], ["So I would  suggest updating the resume, submitting at least 3 applications a day, finding some  references, performing volunteer work  to build your resume, lastly perhaps start up a new hobby or develop your skills in your free time."], ["Sounds like you have a plan, good work"], ["spend less time on activities that are not important. For example instead of doing minimum work on mturk you could be better preparing."], ["that is a great idea and will get you off to a great start"], ["I think that's about all I have to offer you unfortunately"], ["no problem you can do it!"], ["Hey, how are you today? Anything on your mind?"], ["Yeah? Can you tell me a bit about these known unknowns?"], ["Ah man, thats pretty unlucky isn't it, I'm in the same situation, but I think yours is a bit worse."], ["Hey, I feel you there on the anxiety, you'll definitely get through this."], ["Thats what anxiety is all about, the best you can do is figure out how to address those unknowns."], ["I lost my job, started coding, doing odd-jobs, and learning survival skills.

Have a nice night!"], ["I'm sorry to hear that, what's got you down?"], ["I can relate to being in a rural area being hit right now.

It's a good teaching moment for our kids and showing how to collectively work to take care of one another."], ["Just think of all of the ways our kids are learning to adapt to different life situations as well. That's worth just as much as their formal education. Your concerns are valid, and hopefully finding another safer school works out and this whole thing is over soon."], ["That's a great idea, helping fill time with things to distract is a good way to relieve stress as well."], ["What region are you in?

Probably some big changes?"], ["It sounds like you're facing some potential instability which can definitely increase anxiety.

For a longer approach, have you thought about gaining some new skills for the job market?"], ["Sounds like reading might be a good way to get your mind out of the anxiety loop, does that sound right?"], ["That's great! Maybe you can take that a step further and read some material on mindfulness"], ["So, you don't feel like you have a secure spot right now, is that right?"], ["Can you tell me what your job is?"], ["Ok, have there been any talks about layoffs? Or any concerns about your performance?"], ["So you're nervous about things that might happen in the future, but there's no talks about anything concrete?"], ["Hi, how are you today?"], ["I am pretty good."], ["What is going on with you today?"], ["So from what I understand you are feeling upset because you feel like you haven't given back what your parents were able to provide you>"], ["From the few messages we have exchanged, I can tell you are extremely upset by this,"], ["I myself have had issues with feeling like I haven't been able to give back to my parents what they have given me, it is a really hard situation to be in,"], ["Those are completely normal feelings to have, but I know you can get through this!"], ["Have you been able to talk to your parents about this? I think that it would help you to tell them what you are feeling."], ["Have you reached out and tried to talk to a professional about this as well?

I have a feeling you'll both be relieved when you do."], ["I'm sure she's considered it, expressing interest in both of those areas could just be that you're sending mixed messages too.

As we've gotten older it seems like our family has gotten split apart a bit more and everyone is too stressed and hurried to enjoy the old things that we used to do.

Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills."], ["Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them.

The thing is though you cant focus on that or it will bleed out into your job. You have to try to stay positive and promote positivity even with how hard it can be."], ["Oh sorry i guess it came off wrong. I meant try not to let it overwhelm you so you can focus more on the kids."], ["I know my kids school has had issues with parents not being there or helping and they were able to intervene. Is that not available at your school?"], ["I am sorry to hear that i really am"], ["Yeah i know, and schools have had since march of last year to really prepare but it feels like they left everything to the last minute.

Get a bit of perspective."], ["Do you want to go into whats going on right now?"], ["I see, have you just started them?"], ["With medicine like that, it can take months to take its full effect. Stopping can reverse and even make the depression come back worse. Have you told your Doctor your concerns?"], ["Hmm, well yes this can be helpful but that is strange he did not run any tests to see how the medication is reacting with you. On that note though what is going on with you now?"], ["I would look to talk to a therapist about these matters. Platforms like this can help with some issues but if you are not reacting to the medication and these thoughts are still occurring then that is the path i would take."], ["Im not telling you to quit on your therapist but if their techniques are not working for you, or you do not think they are a good fit. You should not feel guilty looking for one that is better suited to your needs.

So there has been a past history of this."], ["And what are your friends and family saying to you? Are their accusations valid?"], ["I know for me, sometimes friends and family will say things like this is they personally do not like the partner themselves without taking your feelings into consideration"], ["Ok I see. And for yourself, do you see a future with him? Because in the end it matters how you feel. Do you feel taken advantage of?"], ["So possible cheating aside - there is definitely some others issues that needs solving. Have you calmly confronted him saying that he is affecting your personal financial goals?"], ["I think you may have answered your own question. I know it is hard, but if someone shows a pattern and they do not change their behaviour, most likely they will not anytime soon. Meanwhile, your mental health and finances will suffer.

HOw are you today?"], ["OH no, why are you feeling this way?"], ["I can imagine, it's so tough right now for everyone. You aren'y alone. Are you in school or at home?"], ["Are you able to connect with friends while on break even virtually? That always helps!"], ["That's so great.

I am assuming you have had other test in these classes."], ["I can tell you are stressed, try to relax, are you in a study group?"], ["They are all probably feeling the same way.

That will help you feel less stressed."], ["your gonna do great.  your welcome."], ["bye"], ["Yes please. What has been bothering you?"], ["oh wow. Is that hard for you?

What do they say?"], ["It sounds like that expectation is very hard on you and makes you anxious"], ["That's okay to feel that way!"], ["Deep down they really just want you to succeed. But that doesn't mean it isn't difficult for you. I'm sure you're doing your best."], ["Have you talked to them about the pressure/expectation?"], ["I would suggest talking to them about the expectation.

Why are you so sad?"], ["Good afternoon! OH no . I am sorry to hear that. Why are you so sad?"], ["So you are sad because they don't understand you and they are jealous of you maybe?"], ["I can understand how you could feel sad and left out but its your life. I think you know whats best for you. Its not like you are 16"], ["I mean you are 29 give me a break .

May I say something with no disrespect since we just met"], ["God is on the throne and in Control . I am not just saying this because it happens to be Sunday.

Also, what experience do you have?"], ["Does CSR stand for Customer Service Representative?"], ["Well, CSR and experience in Banking must mean you have some skills that are in high-demand.

However, i hear that you have always found it fascinating,have you considered talking to your uncle and seeing if you can find what you loved about it again?"], ["Studying can be really difficult , especially when you are half way through. i struggled in my studies and found that talking to my tutors helped and approaching student support.

Do you find it easy to write things down?"], ["One suggestion is for you to write down all the reasons that you love microbiology. It can be any format, I love a bubble chart (mind map), it could be in list form or just doodles, would this be something you would find useful?"], ["It would be a really good place to start. Then you could be really kind to yourself and take some pressure off. Would you like to talk through some ideas to help with the work itself?"], ["That's really good, sometimes it is about finding a direction and small steps. Often when we are studying the work seems really big, especially essay questions. One thing that helped me was to break it into really small chunks, sometimes physically covering up some of the question.

Good luck"], ["Hi, I am doing well thank you, how are you doing?"], ["is there anything specifically that is stressing you out the most right now?"], ["that is really hard.

I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Did you want to talk just to talk? Or we can discuss a way to work through what you might be dealing with mentally?

I am entirely at your disposal."], ["That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much.

I would bet that they felt the same when they started."], ["That certainly is something I can relate. There was a period of time in school where i signed up for way too many classes and had to drop out of a few. If you feel like you are in over your head it is ok to take a step back.

There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago.  Which state do you live in?"], ["I agree it's bad!  Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again.  I just keep thinking this is temporary!"], ["I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.

Yeah these times right now are really difficult to feel motivated and get things done, especially when a lot of school is online"], ["I get that 100%. It's also been really hard on me to not be able to see the people I'm close too. I don't live with family anymore, so I haven't seen my family for months either. So I understand where you are coming from."], ["But you shouldn't feel upset at yourself for how you are feeling. It is completely normal, and I'm sure all your friends are feeling the same way! I have a few things I would like to share with you about how I have been getting through it. Maybe it will help you out :)"], ["Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done."], ["It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies.

I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :)"], ["You could also plan out your days if it would help!

I know that you are probably also hurting from the breakup itself too, but I'm glad to hear that you are focusing on getting yourself to a safe place first.

I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming."], ["Good, I hope that helps. I would also trying to reach out to others who are experiencing the same.

So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation?"], ["Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health"], ["I also recommend making an educational plan.

I get where you are coming from. I have a few friends that no matter how long you discuss, they won't let the conversation end unless \"they are right.\" It seems like your friend doesn't like it when he is wrong?"], ["Gotcha so not only are you frustrated with what he is doing, but you are also worried about his reputation! First of all, can I ask if he is just your friend online or if you hangout with him in person too?"], ["Okay I see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost \"hiding\" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person."], ["A suggestion I would make would be to hangout with him in person, and bring up the issues that you and your friends have been seeing. But it's important to not make him feel overwhelmed. Almost like he is being \"ganged up on.\""], ["I can tell that you care about this person as a friend, but you are worried that the way he thinks and talks may ruin that in a way. Make sure to let him know these concerns! It will show him that you guys truly are doing it out of love."], ["And yes I have actually had a very similar experience! Let me explain"], ["One of my best friend's and roommate, had a very hard time separating friendship and roommate issues. It caused a lot of issues in the relationships with our friends. She had a tendency to discuss issues over text and didn't like doing it in person. But we realized, the problem with that is that you can't tell the emotion behind messages on a screen. But once we talked in person, our issues were solved because we could hear the intended emotions behind what we were saying"], ["Yes exactly. It sounds like he might have other reasonings behind his actions. And you guys talking to him as friends in person, would show him that you care and that he is in a safe environment. He doesn't need to be so extreme"], ["Yes of course! I wish you the best in overcoming this hard time with your friend. I believe that you guys will be able to talk through it since it's a newer issue. :)"], ["Of course! Have a good rest of your day"], ["Hey, how's it going?"], ["What is it about your job that you don't like?"], ["Bleh, sorry to hear that. I think I understand what you're saying."], ["Perhaps it's like following through on your work goals is challenging enough, and then there's a bunch of unnecessary effort on top of it to work around the politics."], ["Yeah, maybe I have. I guess I've been in situations when I was surprised and confused as to why a team couldn't just work together towards the common goal. Does that sound similar?"], ["For sure. It's true that you don't *have* to work there, but I'm sure there are factors in play that make it difficult to leave."], ["Here's a blunt question- what do you want to do about it? Do you think you want to get better at being happy in this job? Or work towards getting another job?"], ["Small steps, I suppose. What do you think the very very first, small step would be?"], ["Nice! That's a good first step."], ["And it's a step that doesn't cost anything to do. Just some time, maybe. Do you think you have enough time nowadays to start looking into that?"], ["Yep, for sure. It's not going to be easy."], ["Most likely! The only thing keeping me from saying definitely is because I don't know all the info. But sure."], ["I gotta believe that switching careers is much more common nowadays than it was one or two generations ago. People you meet along the way will understand."], ["Absolutely. Work can affect mental health particularly when it seems like your efforts aren't going towards anything meaningful. Is that how it feels at your job now?"], ["Good to know. Because maybe that's something you could keep in mind when you think about new jobs. Does this job allow me to see meaningful outcomes from my effort, and so on."], ["That's cool, thanks for saying that. It was nice talking with you!"], ["That seems like a tough situation! What feelings made you decide you need to breakup with her?"], ["I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because I didn't feel like I loved him as much as I used to. Things like that are important!"], ["How long have you guys been together?"], ["Oh I see. That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you?"], ["Have you communicated with her about your concerns? Such as being difficult to live with?"], ["I think it's great that we got matched up, because I went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing."], ["I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!"], ["Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's."], ["Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore."], ["And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love"], ["I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just \"kicking her to the curb.\" Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard"], ["Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!"], ["What I've gathered about you as a person, makes me confident that you probably chose a partner that will be able to have this talk with you and you both will come to an understanding."], ["Yes I think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! It definitely helps. You are welcome! :)"], ["Of course! And it wouldn't be fair to her, just as much as it wouldn't be fair to you. Your happiness is just as important!"], ["Of course! I'm glad that you are feeling a bit better about everything! You as well!"], ["Hello, how are you today?"], ["It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct?"], ["I'm sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it!"], ["I've been in your shoes and also feel that's a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal."], ["It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns."], ["Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that's used towards household bills."], ["Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers."], ["You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use."], ["They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It's easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc"], ["Of course, I hope it can be of use too you! One I use is Mechanical Turk Suite, which is an extension. I think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. Or Mturk forums and find out tons of help!"], ["You're welcome! Best of Luck!"], ["I think you have it. You too."], ["hey there, how's it going?"], ["is there one particular problem or issue that's been on your mind the most lately?"], ["That sounds rough, I'm sorry. Being away from people we care about would make anyone feel pretty bad."], ["You don't have to answer anything you don't want, but I'm curious- how'd you end up 5 hours away from the people you know?"], ["Gotcha. That's rough for you. Sounds like you made a sacrifice to make that happen."], ["Glad to hear that :)"], ["A lot of us feel like we need friends around to keep our mood up, or to get support when we're bummed or bored or sad. Sorry to hear you have less friends nowadays."], ["Are you interested in finding new friends?"], ["Yeah, that's tough. It's tough enough to make friends as an adult in a new city. Tougher still if it seems like a lot of people are into things you don't want to be around."], ["What's a word you'd use to describe your feelings about this issue? Sad, lonely, frustrated, etc?"], ["Bleh, sorry to hear that. And also, that makes sense based on what you've told me."], ["Good talking to you too. Lonely sucks, but in a way it's also okay. I hope you don't feel like you're broken or you're doing something wrong."], ["Good luck to you and stay safe! Have a good day."], ["\\So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it"], ["So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now"], ["You must have had good reason's to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it.  Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards.  You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did.  Im sure the reasons are still valid"], ["So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up.  In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single."], ["I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing.  I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more.  You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time"], ["I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with.  I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won't be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon"], ["Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. Start on that list of self improvements you want to make.  Connect with friends you may have lost touch with.

Can you tell me about what's happening with you at work that's bothering you?"], ["It sounds like you're in a tough spot right now, not knowing what your future will be like."], ["Yes, I can sense that you're quite anxious and fearful."], ["I imagine it must be difficult. From a practical standpoint, have you tried to reach out to people you can trust in your personal and professional network to see whether there are opportunities for work?"], ["It's understandable that you're feeling a sense of panic now. I imagine everyone would feel that way."], ["Yes, the news can be depressing. Is there a support group of some sort in your area?"], ["I have in the past. It's more common than people think."], ["I hope you'll find something too. I've found that when you reach out, people can be more willing to help than you expect."], ["Yes, times are tough for many people."], ["You're welcome. Happy to help."], ["Hello there"], ["Actually I haven't seen the details. How can I help you ?"], ["That must be a real challenge. Anyone would feel stressed in this situation."], ["So you used to rely on his income and now you are struggling to make ends meet?"], ["I have also felt that COVID has added additional pressure in my life. You are not alone in thinking this. It must be tough"], ["So from talking to you it seems like there has been a sudden death which has been difficult, financial challenges as a result and all this is mixed with Covid and moving house. This must be incredibly stressful."], ["Have you tried looking at your problems individually and trying to tackle them in smaller manageable steps?"], ["Have you looked into financial support for people in your situation who care for others, such as government support or subsidies?"], ["Many people are surprised by what help is actually available if they take a look. The government has provided quite comprehensive support, especially for carers."], ["I think you are trying to stay positive which is a good thing. It is easy to give up but I think you can get through this."], ["Not at all but I would suggest looking for help. There is no shame in asking for support. We all need that at times."], ["There is no need to feel embarrassed. I think it shows strength it character to realise when help is needed and your situation is very challenging."], ["You are welcome and I'm glad that it helped."], ["I'm doing really well, thanks.  What brings you here today?"], ["I can appreciate that.  Thinking about lost loves makes me sad too!"], ["What about this particular relationship makes you feel sad?"], ["Oh...I see, you think s/he's the \"one who got away?\""], ["Why did you break up?"], ["Wow...that does sound painful."], ["I know how hard it is to let go of a guy you really loved.  I've had to break up with a few of them over the years!"], ["In the long run, I feel that those break-ups were absolutely necessary.  I'm in a really good place now.  And they are too."], ["I eventually learned to think of it like this: every man I loved taught me something important about myself.  ANd I taught them things about themselves.  ANd it doesn't happen overnight.  But eventually, you will probably be able to see how you grew as a result of the breakup."], ["Maybe the things you will learn can help you be ready for Mr Right!"], ["That's a really good way of looking at it."], ["Oohh.... I think it really depended on how long I was with them.  ANd why I decided to end it.  The longer relationships Maybe a few weeks to a few months before I was ready to move on and try again.

People tend to fear the worst."], ["I think rather than ask her that question directly, you could start the conversation and ask her why she is feeling this way.

She may just want to talk but also be prepared as it may not go the way you plan."], ["Be prepared that she may end the relationship but getting angry is likely not to change her mind.

Do you have anyone who either shares the same opinion as you or does not know your friend that you can talk to?"], ["You have every right to be angry, but the most important thing you can do is find a good support system with your other friend. It will take some time to heal, but I'll tell you a paraphrased version of one of my favorite quotes: \"Resentment is like swallowing poison and expecting the other person to die.\" It's important to find support in your other friends and heal properly."], ["That sounds like a wonderful idea. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?"], ["Can you elaborate more? Earlier you said you and your friend were arguing while she was living in your house, then she stopped talking to you. Why might you be angry with yourself?"], ["If I may, I would argue that your actions don't make you soft and they certainly don't make you stupid. They are certainly not any reason to be angry with yourself. If I may bring up another clich\u00e9: \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\" I would say you're in the \"fool me once\" stage and it is your friend's actions that have brought you pain. I think you're unlikely to trust her again."], ["Also, hindsight is 20/20. What you might see now in ways that your friend might have used you are things that you might not have seen then. We want to think the best of our friends until they prove us wrong. I think you were being the best friend you could be."], ["Of course.

Similar stuff is happening where I am, and I also get anxious hearing about it."], ["What do you feel when you feel on guard and paranoid? Try to say some more about that if you can."], ["Thanks, I hope the same for you."], ["Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety.

You feel stuck. The usual things you would do now are just not available to you."], ["I can rephrase some of this, if you don't mind. In a way, you're talking about activities that you may have used (gym, hikes, etc) to keep yourself in a good mood. Now that those don't seem available, you just don't have those opportunities to boost your mood. It makes sense that you would be feeling this way."], ["I think you explained yourself really well. Thanks for sharing how you've been feeling."], ["Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them?"], ["Yeah, and that just throws on another layer of why things are difficult right now. No one wants to feel guilty for doing things that could help themselves."], ["Have you ever heard of the phrase \"black or white thinking?\" As in, thinking that situations or people are completely good or completely bad? Or completely doable or completely impossible?"], ["Yeah, I think I understand that too. I get really frustrated hearing about people hosting big parties or not wearing masks because they think it's no big deal. They're putting others at risk."], ["I think we all do black-or-white thinking to some extent.

That can be frustrating."], ["When did this start?"], ["When my children were in the same situation I felt a lot of heat too from my parents.  It's helpful sometimes to talk to a school counselor.

Please correct me if I am wrong."], ["I can feel your anxiety just through this chat conversation."], ["In my experience, even if we were to fail, we are bestowed with a valuable life lesson which we can use in future decisions.

It won't cure your depression but it may help your headspace and your point of view."], ["Have you written it down?  Like physically written it down?

Often times guilt robs us of the ability to take care of ourselves, which happens to me all the time."], ["I think that's a systemic problem. Guilt is this powerful check when we do things that are wrong but self love is not wrong. When you constantly take care of others, you might forget to take care of yourself.

I don't mean to be rude, but I have trouble asking for help and sometimes asking people for help seems like this huge, monumental task. But people can often surprise you. Of course, If you have, then I'd suggest looking up some motivational apps and trying meditation. While it can be hard with two young kids, meditation, even for only a few minutes, will help you relax through your doubt long enough to handle the challenges of the day.

It also helps to make sure that it\u2019s dark and very quiet.  Surprisingly enough, when they did research on sleep disorders they found that a lot of people just needed quiet and darkness."], ["Yep, I\u2019ve tried a LOT of things.  I\u2019m currently struggling with this myself.  I\u2019m even trying out melatonin, tryptophan, and even CBD (not stoney weed oil)!

I think you truly are better off without them"], ["The saying that we can choose our friends but not our family is very true."], ["You're most welcome :) We need to keep talking till fifteen mins is up though. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?"], ["No worries :). Please try not to fret too much about your problem - to be honest I have some weird family members too"], ["Wow... that is seriously toxic.

I have been depresed before, and self-isolating can be a symptom, I've been there..."], ["Hmm.

Hopefully, he won't want you feeling that way, and will open up a bit."], ["Yes I can see that being concerning when you know nothing about the friend.   Yet you walk a fine line because he needs the freedom and autonomy to choose his friends without explanation required...it's such a balancing act.

Do you have a nighttime routine to help you get to rest in a more relaxed state?"], ["I'm sorry to hear that you haven't had success with routines. I have suffered with sleeplessness due to bad dreams as well. I find doing yoga with meditative breathing allows me to clear my mind, and sleep better. Do you practice any meditation?"], ["Having high anxiety makes it very hard to concentrate on meditation. I take a medication for anxiety that has helped me a lot.

Does the co-worker have a legitimate reason to ask for the report? Is it important to the company?"], ["The co-worker hopes to get in their good graces by looking productive. is that right?"], ["Ok. This has been going on for some time. Is it possible to discuss the matter with your manager? With HR?"], ["That's a challenging situation! What do your other co-workers think of this behavior?"], ["Would you feel comfortable talking to them about this issue?"], ["I suppose it depends how you frame the issue to them. If you say, \"So-and-so is bothering me and I can't stand it\" then you are complaining."], ["However, if you ask them for their opinion,"], ["and say, \"What has your experience with so-and-so been?\" it might open up a conversation."], ["Hell, even that's ok sometimes."], ["Is there anything you'd like to talk about?"], ["Are you hurt because you lost someone?"], ["That's a tough one. I imagine you have a lot of pain after that."], ["How would you feel if you were her?"], ["It is good to try."], ["Have you ever considered some outside help, like a therapist? There are many out there and you might find it helpful."], ["I myself have done it and it helped."], ["It helps to have someone to talk to."], ["You are very welcome. Good luck!"], ["Nice to meet you, Marie. How are you doing today?"], ["I see. That sounds like a difficult situation. Could you tell me a bit more about your job?"], ["After you get home, you focus on your boyfriend when he comes home from work. Do I understand correctly?"], ["Ok. So you are having some conflict with your boyfriend?"], ["Are the issues about money? Work? Many different things?"], ["Ok. So you would like to have more information about his schedule and when you will be together with him. Is that correct?"], ["Ok. He is socializing with his co-workers and you would prefer that he come home and spend time with you. Is that right?"], ["Ok. Socializing with co-workers is sometimes part of the job. Of course, your relationship with him is much more important, or it should be to him. What does he say when you talk to him about this?"], ["Ok. By the way, do you have friends that you could socialize with? I understand that you want to spend time with him, but what other people do you have in your life?"], ["Ok. Do you enjoy chatting with people online? You seem to chat well with me, so I think that you could connect with others virtually."], ["Hobbies are a good way to connect with people. What do you like to do?"], ["Ok. My suggestions is that you find a friend or two to connect with virtually or physically. Perhaps joining a club, a gym or a class would help. This is one way for you to gain control of the situation."], ["Passive entertainment is not bad, but it does not help you make friends. Zumba and other activities are great for health and can help you meet people. Is there a place in your neighborhood?"], ["You might want to see a medical doctor about that. There are probably treatments that would help you adjust to social settings."], ["Sometimes there are free clinics, and perhaps a university has programs so that their students can learn to help patients."], ["True, but it is important to take steps toward changing your situation."], ["I hope that this chat has helped you."], ["I understand. Life is about change. The past can loom large and we need to understand how it affects our perspective on life."], ["Ok. You are not them. You are a different person. You can make your own choices."], ["That is a good first step. Good for you!"], ["Now it is time for more steps."], ["That is an odd request. Why do you think he wanted that?"], ["It sounds like you have unresolved conflict with your father."], ["Ok. Well, I've enjoyed chatting with you. I need to go now."], ["I am doing well, I am sorry to hear you are upset"], ["I'm very sorry to hear you are feeling this way"], ["Have you tried talking to her?"], ["wow, there is a lot going on for sure, I hope it assures you too know that tough times to pass."], ["Do you have another outlet? Someone else to turn to? Maybe get a hug?"], ["Waiting for the time to pass is like torture sometimes, I know"], ["I am happy you have more support"], ["Do you have a car or a way to get there if you wanted to?"], ["well the fact that you recognize that is a big deal"], ["Accepting the truth is the hardest"], ["That is great you have started saving"], ["there are many new money saving APP's out there, some make it easy to achieve a goal, maybe that is something you could check out?"], ["I understand what you are saying"], ["Opening themselves up to the opportunity to be hurt again....."], ["that is the only way to know whether you will love or trust someone, the trickiness that is life!"], ["that is the sad thing, you kind of have to accept that getting hurt will always be a possibility, maybe it won't sting as much when someone has to go an prove you right...."], ["that's my thought"], ["Yes! That is a great way to put it!"], ["Just never forget you are worthy of love, happiness, and nothing but good things"], ["I am happy I could help"], ["Things will look up!"], ["I am happy you let the words sink in!"], ["a smile face is a good sign!"], ["Thank you!!"], ["Hi there, how are you feeling today?"], ["Are you wanting to get back to work?"], ["Well yes I can concur with that. I have often found work takes my mind off my problems."], ["Well that's not a phrase that I much like. But there's nothing wrong with liking your job."], ["It's okay :) I did not realise that it predated Hitler. On another note, tell me about your job?"], ["Well, a lot of people have been made redundant due to the pandemic - but that is not a reason why people should be happy with a dead end job. Would you consider something else?"], ["It's okay to coast for a while if it's paying the bills but in the long term it won't be very satisfying. What would be your chances of retraining?"], ["What about a whole new career though? Something you'd never even considered before?"], ["I know but think about how worth it it would be! Did you have anything you wanted to do as a child that you never did?"], ["Could it possibly be some sort of mid life crisis? I am forty five and frankly am starting to question everything in my life."], ["heh it does creep up on you trust me :D"], ["On that note thank you for talking and have a lovely day!"], ["Hi, good afternoon."], ["Losing a job is always anxious."], ["Why do you think you will lose your job?"], ["Oh so your job is not protected and your short term disability will end soon? Is that correct?"], ["I see. Have you spoken to HR?"], ["Your department manager is not answering you?"], ["Have you tried mentioning that to HR?"], ["Yes that is how most employments work about providing personal information."], ["That in itself causes anxiety to most since other forms of communication is not possible especially if they are not responding to ciritcal matters."], ["No you should not have to feel you made a mistake for the time you  are taking out of work for a necessity."], ["You know yourself more than anybody and you need to take care of yourself."], ["Hello, how are you today."], ["Do you know how long he has been off his meds?  Does he need help getting a refill?

Like his doctor or someone from the hospital."], ["We definitely don't want him to hurt himself or someone else."], ["We definitely don't want him to hurt himself or someone else."], ["Has his sister seen this kind of replace before?  And if so how did they address it then?"], ["That is a really hard place to be.  His doctors phone number is probably on his prescription bottle."], ["The doctor may not be able to get him in the office, but they would have his records and also be able to connect you to a facility to could maybe help him since the hospital can't"], ["I can imagine, I'm worried now too and I don't even know your friend. I really hope you keep me updated on how things go."], ["You're so welcome.  So it sounds like you'll call the doctor office (once you get the number) but please let me know if I can help any other way."], ["lol, very true they do not.  :)"], ["you're so welcome.  glad I could help."], ["It's really sad, your friend is lucky to have you."], ["you as well"], ["hello, how are you doing today?"], ["So you are angry about what happen in the past"], ["hello, are you still there.?"], ["good"], ["so what is bordering you about the past?"], ["yes, i feel the sdasme way too"], ["Yes, so many differences"], ["hmmm, that sounds fun"], ["yea that will  be boring on the long run, just try and mix it up"], ["we always love going out to a place we have never been before"], ["it a good strategy, just make sure you research well about where you wanted to visit before making the trip"], ["and always have a budget plus some extra cash just incase, it always help us doing our expedition"], ["just, just make sure you have fun."], ["yes, u can. That is a very good idea for a family vacation especially after the long covid lockdown"], ["ok, thats good thinking. let everything die down first"], ["Nice talking to you"], ["yes, that sounds like a plan"], ["gat to go now"], ["you are welcome"], ["do enjoy the rest of your day"], ["Hello, how is your day going?"], ["Has trouble relaxing been an ongoing issue?"], ["It can be difficult to balance things like that, I feel you"], ["It must be stressful"], ["That sounds hard"], ["With all that ambition I'm sure you will find a way."], ["Is there anyone you trust that you can ask for help?"], ["There are a lot of counselors available that might be able to help you manage your time to the max."], ["I've taken on too much at one time before but I still found a way through. I bet you can too."], ["You are welcome. Never give up!"], ["I hope that helps and good luck!!"], ["Can you tell me a little more about your situation so I can better understand?"], ["It sounds like your friend's husband might be jealous of your daughter, or embarrassed\n that his daughter did not get moved up also. Have you spoken to your friend about this?"], ["It depends on the depth of the relationship between the three of you. How long have you all been friends?"], ["Yes, that is a difficult situation to know how to handle. It could be in your best interest to leave your friend out of it so she doesn't feel stuck in the middle or forced to take sides. However she could view the opposite as you going behind her back."], ["Yes, coaches are a great resource for life's dilemmas. Perhaps another option would be to casually mention something to him in passing, like at one your daughters games as to avoid any big blowups or emotional exlosions."], ["That is exactly right. Each person handles and avoids conflict differently and you have the important roll as leader in all of this. There is a chance he is not aware of the strain this has put on you emotionally and he could respond well to not being called out by someone else. Does that make sense?"], ["I can understand how you would feel like he doesn't care about the strain it's placed. Can I ask, are your daughters aware or involved in these rumor's? This could make a difference in how you could respond."], ["Sounds like your daughter has a good head on her shoulders. Maybe there's something to be learned from her reaction to all of this. I understand how hard this has been for you so perhaps simply ignoring the rumors will allow you to heal quicker, by simply being the bigger person. Because rumors are just rumors, after all. You and your daughter know the truth and that's all that matters."], ["If he knows you know and you rise above with a smile on your face, that could show him that you are more mature than his childish games, and that you mean business. By taking ownership of your own feelings and emotions, you might find that will squash your need to let out any anger towards him."], ["Exactly. Let his problems remain his. You worry about you and your daughter and he can watch from a distance confused at his failed attempt to reflect his own dissatisfaction with life onto you didn't work. I think you will feel freed\n of any stress this has caused."], ["I'm sorry to hear that! What do you think might be making you sad?"], ["Have you had someone take a look at your resume?

It might not pay as well as medicine, but it could help with the bills."], ["That's understandable. You've trained for a job and you want to get the job. I think that in the long term, you will be able to achieve that!"], ["That's a great idea. I think that you can find something in the short-term. Companies are always looking for capable employees."], ["I'm glad that I was able to help you! Have a great weekend, and best of luck with the job search."], ["Do you have a button on your end for ending the chat?"], ["ah yes lockdown...I don't want to guess how you are feeling, can you explain how you are feeling please?"], ["I know I have been finding it really challenging"], ["okay"], ["hmm I don't understand the question can you rephrase please?"], ["it sounds like you are asking why I want to help people?"], ["I feel good helping others....and a lot of people have supported and helped me in my life, so it feels good to give back"], ["what's happening with your woman friend?"], ["I hope you will find it reward like i do"], ["what is the issue with your woman friend, do you want to talk about it more?"], ["the lockdown has been depressing for me too, I can relate to how you are feeling.

How's it going? How can I help you today?"], ["We all have those days :/ what's bothering you?"], ["It sounds like your having trouble giving yourself that little push to get the wheels turning. I've totally been there. What do you feel is the reason?"], ["I understand, I've been there before. You just have to take one step at a time and not overwhelm yourself . Have you tried any tools to help you get going?"], ["What I find that works is to make out a list of all the things you want to accomplish and the possible steps you need to get there. It also helps to let someone know how you feel like a friend or relative, you would be surprised that being open with people can open up new doors in life."], ["You feel like your friends don't listen or care? And trust me you are not alone. I am going through that as well. I messed up so you can say, but as time went on I realized that I can't live like how I was living anymore and I SLOWLY moved towards my goals. I just graduated phlebotomy school for example."], ["What are your goals?"], ["Thank you! Yeah money is tight these days especially with the pandemic going on. If your business has a good idea there are many venture capitalist that are willing to invest in your idea. You can search for websites and pitch it to them.

Don't get discouraged. It's never too late."], ["Check out crowd funding websites. Like go fund me, indi gogo, kick starter, and just giving."], ["No problem! I'm glad I got to help! Please check out those websites especially kick starter because you basically pitch your idea and people invest in real time. Right away."], ["I'm really glad I got to talk to you, you can do it. At least you have goals right?! That's already passed the first step. You got this! I hope everything works out for you."], ["I'm so sorry that happened. Are you mostly hurt because he didn't tell you he was seeing somebody else?"], ["You must feel really torn up about it. I can tell that you care about your relationship."], ["Maybe he didn't intend to hurt you. Its not like he invited you over to tease you. It is true that he didn't keep his promise, and that's his fault."], ["That would definitely add to the distress of the situation to have a weird surprise like that. It doesn't really seem like your fault that you were there but it is unfortunate nonetheless. Have you tried talking to h\nim yet?"], ["That's ok, you have a vested interest in this person. It is natural to be interested in such things."], ["There are a lot of therapists out there that might be able to help you navigate this. It's OK to get some outside help."], ["Considering how much time you've put in to this relationship, I can tell you have a lot of feelings about all of this."], ["Really, it is no problem. It helps to let it out sometimes, I feel that.

I am encountering a similar situation, looking for a well suited job."], ["Have you tried looking in to new career fields that have always interested you?"], ["There are a lot of jobs in technology where the only requirement is learning a few courses, such as programming."], ["It would be nice to work in a field that you also enjoy!"], ["It can seem hopeless right now, but think about how you felt when you were in a better position."], ["That helps me balance things out in my head sometimes. Sometimes we get stuck. It happens."], ["Accept that you are anxious so you can control it instead of it control you. Accepting actually makes you less focused on it, because you don't have to wonder about it."], ["I hope that helps and good luck!"], ["I am doing great, how about you?"], ["Of course you can, tell me about it :)"], ["Why so?"], ["Hey I've been there too, but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things. You should try it!"], ["Nothing special, just sit in my room in silence. Listen to tutorials on youtube to meditate"], ["They get me relaxed and motivated for the day :)"], ["That's part of meditation! I too worry while meditating, but when i'm listening to the videos and following instructions all those worries go away :) If that doesn't help you, you can go out in nature to clear your mind off things. Being in the wild really motivates me to continue."], ["Meditating absolutely does since the whole point is to clear your mind off things and concentrate on the task ahead.\nAnd the wild? that's whole other experience because you either concentrate on things or you get mesmerized by nature :)"], ["Please do! You can try it with friends or alone. With friends can be a more fun experience while alone can be more spiritual or calming"], ["I have tried both and both are amazing :)"], ["Hi\nHow may I help you today?"], ["sure! you can discuss. that's why I am here for."], ["You had so many friends in past, now you had fight with them.

It must be a stressful."], ["When I have fight with friends, I try to clarify the things I where I went wrong or they made mistakes."], ["From past I have learnt that, friendship should be very transparent. There should be any space for thank you and sorry. It should be straight forward. If my friends doesn't like anything which I did, she should say that straight to me. I should respect her saying. Then it stays there for ever."], ["Yes, I would say that is human nature. Only thing is to do self realization."], ["You are most welcome! it you are feeling much better now. Is there anything else that I can help you with?"], ["why would you say that?"], ["is there anything I can help you with?"], ["do you think a drink will help you?"], ["why not try to put attention in some other things instead of a beer"], ["its only in your mind"], ["like working out? it will give you a lot of benefits especially with your health"], ["you can do it!"], ["oh that's nice"], ["youre welcome!"], ["of course you can try different things"], ["just do it with moderation, don't be mad at youself"], ["we all want to eat sweets"], ["no, don't be like that you know you have to love youself"], ["hope I help you somehow"], ["of course, just be confident of yourself and most of all appreciate yourself, I think it will help"], ["I am not so bad. Is there anything you'd like to discuss with me today?"], ["Are you not happy in your current job? It's a bad time to be job hunting really."], ["What sort of work are you looking for? Would you be prepared to take something outside of your usual field?"], ["Sometimes it is necessary to take a temporary job that you don't really like just to make ends meet alas."], ["Well true but if there's no work out there that will help build your career you kind of don't have much choice ;)"], ["Have you thought of taking some sort of refresher or training course? There are quite a few available."], ["Hmmm well how are your computing skills? That's a great field to be in at the moment."], ["Well that would be an interesting thing to learn don't you think? Though I don't know much about them myself I must admit."], ["It would but if you've nothing better to do due to the pandemic it might be worth it"], ["Have you considered registering with employment agencies for temp work?"], ["Me too. It can be a bit soulless but it does pay the bills when you don't have anything else to do."], ["Anyway I hope that I have been able to help you a little and that you are feeling a little more positive about things?"], ["That's quite all right. The wait times can be a bit long. How are you?"], ["Working from home is not what people expected. Many have found themselves isolated. They miss the interaction of the office. How long have you bee working from home?"], ["Have you and your co-workers talked to your boss about a hybrid schedule, maybe a couple days a week in the office? That might work."], ["I see. That's a concern. So you feel that if one person goes in to the office, then everyone else will have to? There won't be any flexibility?"], ["Hm. A bit of a dilemma. Can this situation go on forever though? Maybe the boss will extend the stay-at-home for a while, but when other companies go back to the office, the expectation will be there for all companies."], ["Other employees might change their minds bit by bit as well."], ["True. I don't think you are alone. Is there something that you can do to make working at home better for you? More frequent breaks? Better work space?"], ["True. It might be easier to work at home when you have a chance to get out of the house during your free time."], ["Most people didn't plan for the long term because nobody thought that this was a sustainable way to work. By the way, if your company wants you to stay home, then it might help buy the equipment you need to be productive."], ["I think if you talk to your co-workers, they'll have ideas for upgrading your workspace."], ["I think that's a great idea! People probably want to connect without having to talk about work. Later on, they might want to do the same thing but face-to-face."], ["Sure! My pleasure. Best of luck with all that! Have a great weekend!"], ["Is there a quit/finish button on your end?"], ["Oh wow I am sorry to hear that - it is a bad time to be out of work isn't it?"], ["There are organisations out there who can help due to the exceptional circumstances .. do you have anyone helping you?"], ["Hmm, could you google for local organisations such as Citizen's Advice? I have found them very useful personally."], ["They provided me with loads of helpful advice and other people to get in touch with. Also, have you considered using a food bank?"], ["There are religious organisations that can sometimes help too and would not expect you to be of their religion."], ["Try not to worry about it - it is not just you. The job market is awful right now but it will pick up again!"], ["Are you eligible for unemployment benefits?"], ["But surely you should be eligible anyway, unless you just walked out"], ["Wow that is really not fair of them! I think you have grounds for legal action there"], ["You really should - nobody has the right to dismiss you due to your health problems, that is totally outrageous."], ["I realise the prospect of legal action can be daunting and potentially expensive but you should be able to get legal aid and it sounds as though you really have been badly treated here."], ["You'd need to get legal aid. Try and find a solicitor who works pro bono."], ["Anyway I hope that I have been able to give you some help and guidance and that things look up for you in the very near future! Try to hang in there."], ["That's great .. I really hope it works out for you. Don't worry, you're not the only one to be in this situation and things can and do pick up"], ["Thanks for talking!"], ["Can you press quit and take the survey - I am not able to from this end :)"], ["Hi, how are you? What would you like to talk about today?"], ["That's too bad. Did they not invite you? Where are they going?"], ["I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have a falling-out?."], ["The pandemic has been hard on many people. I figure many friendships are going through a rough patch, eh."], ["A busy time of the semester. How's school going for you?"], ["School's going well enough for you. You'd like to re-establish ties with your friends. Do you do other stuff with them besides going to bars?"], ["That sounds like a good opportunity to see which way the wind is blowing, so to speak. Maybe you can feel them out to get a sense of what might be wrong?"], ["Coffee is casual, but people open up when they're drinking. That'll loosen their tongues."], ["Don't take it personally. It's just one trip to a bar. There might be something else going on that you don't know about. Don't jump to conclusion. If they keep snubbing you, then you need to worry a bit."], ["That's a swell idea! Easter is a day of redemption and forgiveness. Maybe invite them over and have some Easter ham and Easter wine."], ["I've had a bit of Easter wine this evening. Easter drinking starts on Friday. Puts the \"good\" in \"Good Friday.\""], ["Okay, I know the feeling! Can you at least make a start tonight? That will make you feel better."], ["Naughty! Though I must admit I understand that feeling too ;) Could you not at least rattle out a few paragraphs before you go?"], ["And try not to overdo it or you won't be able to work tomorrow either and then you'll really be in trouble"], ["Have you at least done some groundwork for the paper even if you've not started writing it yet?"], ["Well at least you can continue mentally preparing for it when you are out tonight"], ["Nobody ever INTENDS to get blackout drunk :D"], ["And you never know, you might get a creative burst when you get back and rattle it off in one."], ["Oh yeah. Follow it up with a smoke and you'll be a regular Shakespeare. He was probably half cut all the time too."], ["i live in a rural area with lots of forests :P"], ["Hmph I am not a very good counsellor am I? I should be telling you to stay in and work. But hey, life is short and beer is good."], ["Of course :). Hmm it's been many years since I was in Uni. Too many."], ["Ah it's a good field to be in. Do you suffer from anxiety generally or is it just over this paper?"], ["and exams too I will bet. Does your school offer any free counselling?"], ["I wish you all the best with it and thanks for talking! Do enjoy your night out and don't overdo it ;)"], ["have fun :P (you have to be the one to press quit first, I can't this side)"], ["I am sorry to hear that. It must be even more difficult in a pandemic time. When did this happen? If you don't mind telling me more about it."], ["How are you doing recently? Do you have any coping mechanism that you can share with me? I can lend you an ear."], ["I went through the same process. I understand what you are feeling. I am glad that you are on Mechanical Turk and interacting with people. Which area do you live in? It is springtime and pretty outside. Have you thought about walking more walks?"], ["Yeah, I like to clear my head by taking a walk. I know it is a temporary relief, but it helps regulate my mood. Do you live with people, do you have conversation with people regularly?"], ["It sounds like you know what you are doing and you have a support system of your choice. Do you share stories like breaking up with girlfriend with them?"], ["I have the same tendency. I don't feel comfortable imposing my struggle and my thoughts with people. I would personally recommend you sharing a little bit more with family during Easter. It doesn't have to be the intimate details of the breakup, it can be generic feeling, like loneliness."], ["I am glad that you find it helpful. I wish I can be around to hear more about it."], ["I hope you all the best."], ["No. I actually recommend a book called It is ok that you are not OK. It helped me personally and makes me a more emotionally intelligent person."], ["Hi, how are you doing?"], ["Oh that's not good. Has he been putting pressure on you not to get the vaccine?"], ["I know it can be really frustrating. I 've had a friend like that before.

Do you need the money, or can you maybe take a short break from work until you catch up?"], ["True. Once you're on the other side of this semester, you can put in more hours.

Perhaps she would be willing to explain in a more neutral environment?"], ["It might be an option.  Maybe just lay out how you feel in it, and just ask her for an explanation perhaps.  It might be good to let her know that \"I understand it's over, but could you help me understand why so that I can close this chapter\" - perhaps she would respond to something like that.  If she doesn't, then you are going to have to make some hard decisions and try to process this."], ["It's a very hard position to be in, but life is too beautiful to be miserable, and I know you would rather be happy."], ["You are going to have to lay it all on the line with her, but be prepared for her to not respond in the way that you want.

How is your relationship with your husband?"], ["Could you be transferring feelings because she has been there for you through a rough time and maybe you feel understood more than you do in your marriage? Can you talk to your wife about your feelings openly?"], ["I am sorry to hear that. I was also married at one time and had similar issues. We never could get passed some issued like having kids or not. I understand it can be difficult coming to terms with someone. It doesn't always work out."], ["That makes a lot of sense and good for you.

Have you ever consider starting a journal. A place to write your deepest secrets?"], ["You need to put yourself first and distance is important.

However, the fact that this woman was given the option to either get rid of her dog or move tells me that you are 100% correct in the way that you handled this situation. It's unfortunate for the woman, yes, but she should have had more control over her dog. It's bad enough when one animal is attacked, but when it's more than one, that's when you really know that it's a problem. Again, legally, she had to make a choice, and that's because she failed to properly secure her dog. I really don't feel as though you did anything wrong."], ["If I were you, I would ask to speak with the neighbors who have an issue with you face-to-face. I know it may be difficult, but I think that would be the best way to go about it. Are you on good terms with the other person whose dog was attacked?"], ["That probably has a lot to do with it. I would feel sorry for her too, as it is very sad in general. However, it doesn't excuse the fact that her animal attacked two other dogs."], ["That is absolutely terrible. In that case, I would just tell them that you refuse to allow another dog to possible injure or kill your own dog, so you did what was necessary to protect your fur-baby. Had you not done anything, this could have happened again, and the outcome may have been much worse. At that point, if they still don't respond kindly, I'd tell them that you still feel as though you did what needed to be done, that you understand why they are upset, but that you will always do whatever it takes to protect your dog. Hopefully, they will stop being mean. Even if they just stop talking to you completely, it's better than them harassing you or something along those lines. If they do start escalating their nasty behavior, I'd let the manager of your complex know that you're being mistreated. I always try to keep things calm and quiet, but I refuse to be taken advantage of or treated poorly."], ["Personally, as I stated previously, I wholeheartedly believe that you did the right thing. If they're unable to see that, I'd try to just avoid contact with them unless it's necessary.

Maybe he is not aware of your situation or how you feel."], ["Oh no. I can see from his part he feels upset and frustrated because he may feel useless at the moment. But that's not an excuse to neglect responsibilities. You can maybe make him feel more useful around the house by starting to assign him small tasks.

Is there anything you can think of?"], ["I agree. Are you a social person by any chance? By saying that I mean you can still go do those activities, but you can maybe meet people there and ask if you can join their group. That's great in a way because you meet new people and there are no attachments after you leave. It's like a fun, crazy experience :)"], ["Oh that's awesome! But just remember don't try to distract yourself from the problem. Try to make peace with it. Because if you don't, you cannot move forward."], ["I am good, thanks. Is there an issue I can provide you some support with?"], ["So, to reiterate, you are suffering from anxiety due to school? Or is your anxiousness also caused by other life factors as well?"], ["I understand what you are going through.

I think it is great that you wanted to go back to school, but if your heart is not in it, then it may not be what you should continue pursuing."], ["I can feel your worries when you speak about your anxiety, and I am hoping we can find a way to approach your feelings. Do you think there was a specific instance that is causing doubts within yourself or is it in your nature to self-doubt?"], ["This has also been a past struggle of mine, and I think it partially stems from the bar we set so high for ourselves. We obviously cannot reach the top right away, but have to work our way up. Often times, when facing an obstacle, such as a bad grade, we might retreat further down the path due to fear that it will keep happening. I know that I personally had a tendency to think of my family and friends who I feel are dependent on me or comparing myself with others when the only person we should think of in these instances is ourself. When making progress, tiny steps upward matter more than you think. But when we take a step backward, we cannot fall back down to the starting point by letting our doubts pile upon one another."], ["Of course, I am happy to help! I have noticed that letting yourself celebrate a good grade can be really helpful to feel that you are enough and making good progress. But when things do go south, because life certainly happens, we must stay in the present and live life like we usually would, with a drive that we are going to push harder against whatever we have to face next."], ["Exactly! I also suggest if you are having doubts, talk it out with someone like your partner or a close friend. They can often provide a pick me up you didn't even know you needed. More than anything, give yourself credit and relax. Take some time to just breathe and release the tension. I guarantee it will leave you feeling refreshed and fulfilled for the next tasks you have to face. I believe you can do this and I feel that you believe it too, which is amazing. As often as it is said, believing in yourself is truly the best foundation to achieve your goals."], ["You're welcome. It was great talking to you.

We continue to be very close 20 years later."], ["I can feel your frustration just by our conversation, and I too wish that she could see that you value both her and your friendship enough to reach out to someone that can just listen.

Have you had any conversation with your daughter about their relationship?"], ["And that is so important and good to know there is trust from his side, to me it sounds as though that could be an olive branch for you to try and establish a conversation with both of them.

Do you have anyone in your life, a friend or family member who you can lean on when you're feeling so sad?"], ["It sounds like it's hard to have your best friend not be as supportive as you want during this hard time. What has been helping you to pass the time these days- do you have any activities or hobbies that you like to do to relax, have fun, or take your mind of things?"], ["That's a great idea. I love taking walks and bike rides outside when I feel down. I also have a little dog and she helps me whenever I'm feeling lonely- dogs are great at providing comfort and unconditional love."], ["My dog has also helped me meet other people and make friends- sometimes I'll walk my dog with others or go on bike rides with friends. If there is a dog park or local park nearby, maybe you can go and talk to other people there- talking about your dogs is a great icebreaker!"], ["I'm glad to hear that! I hope you have a great time there! Research has also shown that spending time outside everyday is really good for our mental health."], ["If you are still interested in getting a bike, I'd say go for it too! Biking is a great stress relief and form of exercise that often makes me feel better."], ["I am so glad to hear that and am so happy you are talking to me is making you feel better."], ["Those are both great ideas! Yoga in the park sounds awesome. Yoga is another great stress reliever and form of exercise that is often free or very inexpensive."], ["I am very glad to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with today? I am here to listen."], ["Reading and journaling are also great tools to use. Even when you are feeling down it can be helpful to write down your feelings as a form of release."], ["That sounds like a great plan. Good luck and I hope you continue to feel better."], ["You're very welcome."], ["I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling angry today. Tell me more about that."], ["I can definitely understand why this could make someone upset. What are you considering doing about the situation?"], ["That sounds really tough. Sometimes people who are in your situation find it comforting to talk to someone they are close with\n. What do you think about this?"], ["It sounds like your sister might be able to help you figure out this situation. It can always be helpful to make a list of pros and cons about the situation. You originally said you were angry because of a discrepancy with your paycheck, but on the other hand it sounds like you are considering quitting your job altogether. What are your thoughts about this?"], ["It always seems easy to read to much into things. Another suggestion is to think about how the clerical error happened. Was it because of your boss? Or perhaps just an accident?"], ["It sounds like you are wanting to tell your boss about this. How do you imagine you will go about telling your boss?"], ["It sounds like you are nervous about saying something mean. What do you think would be helpful for you to do do in order to prepare?

Then when you actually talk with your boss, it will be easier since you already talked about it with your sister."], ["It sounds like you have a great plan in place! I'm glad to hear you are feeling less angry now! :)"], ["I can understand how you feel.

Always asking for help when you need it is a great idea."], ["I'll do my best. What do you need help with?"], ["I can understand why that would make you feel depressed."], ["Yes of course.

Only then can you be truly available for anyone else."], ["Indeed, once you free up some time for yourself, I bet you'll start to feel better."], ["Yes, try meditation for a few minutes each morning."], ["Take a few deep breaths and clear your mind of negative thoughts."], ["meditation allows you to set up your day in your mind and let you be calm."], ["Yes, it won't happen overnight but be patient with it."], ["do you have any other concerns?"], ["I'm hearing that I have helped enough and you don't have any more concerns?"], ["You are welcome, and good bye."], ["Hi Can I help you"], ["You tell me"], ["That's so sad. I am sorry!"], ["I can understand very how your mom is going through hard time."], ["Time will heel her. That I can assure you."], ["Tell her to meditation or yoga in the morning. This will definitely helped and her mind will be  busy"], ["That is wonderful idea too . She will recover soon"], ["Be busy with your daily routine. Planning is the key"], ["Good idea!

That is my advice for you"], ["Your welcome"], ["Start eating more fruits like me. I am trying to eat healthy."], ["Your welcome"], ["Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there something in particular that's wrong?"], ["That sounds really stressful"], ["Are you in a program that lets you choose your own classes?"], ["Oh, that's rough. I've had classes before where I had to take them but had a lot of trouble."], ["Do you know anyone in the class? Maybe you could try studying with them and see if they can help."], ["It sounds like you're overwhelmed by all of the things expected of you"], ["Sometimes schools have programs that can help with this sort of thing, like student support services, that might be able to get you extensions on assignments, or move tests around if they fall on a similar date."], ["You might be right, it depends on the school honestly. It might not hurt to try though if you're really overwhelmed. Another thought is to try talking to your professors or TAs? They might be more sympathetic than you think."], ["I've been a TA for classes before, and even though I sometimes can't do too much to change assignment deadlines, I've always been open to talking to students about their struggles. It helps me to know who to keep an eye on and give extra attention to."], ["Are you feeling any external pressure from your family or advisor to do really well?"], ["That sounds so hard, I think it's awesome that you're trying so hard on your own. Just the fact that you're in a program in the first place is really impressive."], ["I hope you're able to find a support system through your friends, even if you don't have one at home."], ["I know it's hard, but I think you're going to do a great job! And even if you fail a test, it really doesn't matter in the long run."], ["It was great talking with you"], ["Bye!"], ["What happened?"], ["Why did he break up with you?"], ["I think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous."], ["Apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions"], ["It's good for you to do that. You'll feel better with time."], ["I feel the same way. When it had happened with me. However, I talked it with my friends and family and made me feel much better"], ["You should spend time for yourself now. Take care of yourself."], ["I Know that in the beginning it's so difficult to do anything, you just want to sleep and do nothing, but with time you'll feel much better and try start over"], ["Yes. you should do that.

That is a big deal."], ["Have you tried talking to him?"], ["I'm sure that you wouldn't annoy them.

It sounds like you are really having a tough time."], ["What do you think the next step in finding new employment is?"], ["What are your options?"], ["That sounds like a fantastic idea, and even if there is competition, there are still a lot of people that might buy your art from Etsy or Amazon."], ["It sounds like you have a plan. I know that you will do great."], ["Is there anything else that I can help you with today?"], ["You're welcome! Have a nice day!"], ["Thanks!"], ["I understand that.  The pandemic has been very hard to keep connected with everyone. Have you tried talking to your friends about how you are feeling?"], ["It's completely normal to feel like that. I have been in your exact shoes.  I would suggest inviting one of them out for lunch or dinner and express face to face how you are feeling right now."], ["She may be going through something at home or having family issues.  We truly never know what the other person is going through unless we have that uncomfortable situation. My suggestion would be to rephrase that question slightly to her."], ["It's completely natural.  Instead of texting her, have you tried calling?"], ["How long have you been friends?"], ["You both have been friends for such a long time.  I'm so jealous of friendships like that. I would definitely ask her for lunch.  You all have been through so much together. This conversation with her would be a weight off your shoulders."], ["I do not think she would respond that way at all. Once she sees that this has you concerned about your friendship, she will take it serious and open up to you."], ["I'm an only child as well so I understand how you are feeling :)"], ["you are welcome! Glad I could help!"], ["Yes! It can be frustrating at times. But it sounds like you have a plan in order. You just need to execute it."], ["You as well!"], ["I'm okay. What is making you feel tired?"], ["So you are looking for a better job?"], ["Yes, I have observed that about the job market too."], ["You are feeling down about that situation."], ["Have you gotten advice from the school about what to do?"], ["Everyone progresses at their own rate."], ["It sounds like your mood has been a challenge for you to complete school."], ["Not everyone has to go through that, so try to be understanding of yourself."], ["Do they know that you are struggling?"], ["It sounds like they have a lot of their own problems."], ["Is there someone else you could talk to?"], ["Do you listen to his or her problems too?"], ["You could check in with your friend to see how they are feeling about your communication."], ["When people feel they are burdening their friends, it sometimes means they should find a counsellor to talk to."], ["Venting is important, it's true."], ["That's really positive."], ["You're welcome."], ["I know what it's like to not know the future and to be depressed."], ["You too!"], ["Hi, how are you today?"], ["I see, I've been feeling that way too recently."], ["Is there anything in particular that has you upset or just life in general?"], ["That makes total sense. Covid's been going on for so long, life is so different now."], ["Do you want to talk about what's going on with your mom?"], ["I think it's really great that you're doing all that for her! It must be extra hard to have to limit public interactions even more than most people."], ["That sounds so stressful to have to be worried about her on top of everything else. I'm so sorry you're going through that."], ["Have you been able to keep in contact with friends through video chat? That's something that can sometimes help when feeling isolated."], ["It sounds like you don't think the online interactions are a good substitute for in-person things. Does that sound right?"], ["Ah, that sounds like kind of a cycle of guilt going on. Where she feels bad about you not being able to go out, and you feel bad about her feeling bad."], ["Yeah that makes complete sense. It seems like you have a good idea of who you are and what your needs are."], ["I wonder if you could do something like take walks in the park with friends, or see them with masks where you're really socially distanced from everyone"], ["I really hope things get better for you. Covid should be ending soon hopefully with the vaccine, and things will start to go a bit back to normal"], ["Yeah! I hope that works out for you. I've been finding getting outside and doing things with others has been helpful both for social and exercise."], ["It's been really nice chatting with you :)"], ["No problem! How are you doing? How can I help you today?"], ["I am very sorry to hear that. Facing pay cuts at work can be a very stressful situation."], ["Are there situations or moments that specifically make you feel like this is going to happen? Or are you just feeling a general sense of anxiety and fear it might happen?"], ["I can definitely understand why that would be difficult.  Dealing with uncertainty during the pandemic is extremely difficult, as there are so many unforeseen circumstances."], ["One thing that helps me out in those moments, is to remember that there are things in the world and life that I can control, and others that I can't control."], ["It seems like the best thing you can do at the moment is try your best to do the best you can at your job. If there will be paycuts, you might not be able to prevent it. But at least you will know that you gave a valiant effort."], ["I just wanted to remind you to remember, anxiety about something that has not happened yet is not always helpful to yourself. By focusing directly on what you can do, you can make sure you are prepared for anything negative coming your way."], ["Is there anything else you need help with?"], ["Good, I am very glad to hear that. I am wishing you the best in the future and definitely feel free to contact me if you need support again!"], ["Do you need any help with any other questions?

We have to deal with this covid situation."], ["I can understand how you feel. It is very difficult"], ["School started already . That good idea to go and attend"], ["You are so kind. Thinking about your parents. Only few months you have to deal. She will get vaccine soon"], ["I got last week my first dose. Tell her not to be scared at all."], ["Don't worry at all. Believe me"], ["Not at all. It is very easy. Easier than flu shot"], ["Your welcome"], ["Definitely. I am assuring you will be fine very soon."], ["Good luck"], ["Can you tell me more about why you are scared for the future?"], ["It seems that Covid has had a negative effect on your employment and financial insecurity is weighing heavily on you."], ["I can understand that feeling of insecurity, and how helpless you feel. I myself have been in the position of loss of income and financial insecurity in the past, and while it was hard while I was in the valley, I was able to walk out of it with some valuable lessons."], ["It sounds like you are already identifying areas of self improvement. A person with confidence in themselves and the ability to reflect and grow are promising attributes potential employers look for."], ["You are so welcome. I know that you will succeed in your employment search as you have the skills and humility that potential employers are looking for."], ["As you continue your job search, can you think of ways that you could trim your cost of living for the short term? Returning to the basics for a time could help save you money while you take the next steps with your career. Things like planning meals ahead of time, using items you already have instead of buying new, letting go of subscriptions you don't use daily or don't deem necessary."], ["Our lifestyle seems to be all about convenience and instant gratification, I myself being guilty of wanting those as well. But I think when we strip our needs down to the basics for a while we allow ourselves to find what is really necessary, as well as what is truly important to us."], ["And it is important to remember that everyone goes through cycles of feast or famine, and that when you are walking through a famine you yourself are not a failure. As long as you know you are doing your best to succeed under the circumstances you have been handed, you will never truly be a failure to yourself or to others."], ["I am so glad you have been able to look within yourself to see that you have all the resources you need to handle this period of life.

In this scenario you should take small breaks to relax your body and mind. You will feel better."], ["Time is running bad for all of us. We have to take care of our health at this time. Stress can lead to so many disease and it will be hard to afford that extra burden in terms of time and money."], ["Yes, you should keep looking for it with your current job. There is no harm in being prepared."], ["You should consult a doctor for that. You can try yoga or meditation if you can take little time for yourself."], ["You should try to give bit time to yourself. Try to talk to friends and family over the weekend. All these things always work for me."], ["That's true ! Still you can go and relax in your backyard with family or talk to them on phone. We will feel good."], ["It is my work to help you out. Hope you are feeling bit relaxed. Take care"], ["Can you tell me what happened?"], ["So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct?"], ["I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It's like living alone in the forest."], ["I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do."], ["It seems that you don't want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person."], ["That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure."], ["Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief?"], ["Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think?"], ["I'm sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now."], ["I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air?"], ["Oh, then drive around might be the only option"], ["Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern"], ["Does where you live have a online social activity group on FB or an app called Neighbors?"], ["That could be a good way to communicate with others in a safe way."], ["Give that a try.

Your relationship with your wife or having another child?"], ["Yes, it's tough. Maybe you should think about both scenarios and write down how it would make you feel.

I think it's important to maintain positivity and find any outlet that keeps that going for you."], ["You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today, even if it's something as simple as providing suggestions for new things to try?"], ["Meditation has worked wonder for my best friend. The app Headspace is fantastic. I'd also recommend podcasts, using either and app or your computer, and find a series on a topic that you enjoy, weather it's mindfulness, or self-care. There are plenty to choose from and you can go at your own pace."], ["You're welcome. I hope you find peace within and happiness again. Your grandson will improve with time, it's inevitable! But stay positive, stay focused, and be sure to not take anything out on him as he relies on you and your input. Have a wonderful day!"], ["Hello, glad to meet you virtually. How are you?"], ["I am good.  How may I help you?"], ["I completely get that.  I am thinking that most people are feeling isolated therefore communication with others are feeling even more challenging thank usual.  Playing games can certainly help.  What type of games do you play?  Perhaps there are people that share the same interests"], ["Multi player games help I would assume.  Do you play with people you actually know sometimes?  I am sure that you make a great friend so we can explore areas of meeting new people,  I can tell you that I am not having the easiest time keeping up with friends and I am certainly not meeting new people in person very often myself."], ["Okay so perhaps play with people as opposed to solo.   Do you think it would be worth a try?"], ["You are quite welcome.  Perhaps I can play as well.  Is it easy to catch on or are the games you play difficult?"], ["Got it! Do you play sports or any other activities where you encounter people?"], ["You've come to a good place to start."], ["Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed?"], ["I'm sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband's loss of work and your son's loss of his job is entirely understandable."], ["I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household."], ["That is a really difficult position to be in."], ["Regardless of what your husband's actions are and your son's, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings?"], ["That is very hard emotionally, so I am sorry you have to deal with your son's behavior."], ["That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it's difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help."], ["Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won't be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home."], ["I completely understand that. Especially when it comes to people we are close to, it can be hard to separate our expectations from theirs."], ["I've had to learn this lesson many times with my own children. It's difficult, but ultimately will give you some relief from your resentment."], ["Absolutely! Being a parent is difficult. Remembering to support yourself helps. Making the time to do things to support your wellbeing doesn't make you selfish at all"], ["You are certainly not alone."], ["Has any of this been helpful? Is there more I can do for you?"], ["What's on your mind?"], ["We are on the same boat"], ["I understand how you feel. I think others feel the same too, that we're exhausted no matter if we're directly  affected or not"], ["It saddens me too because even when we have vaccines, the damage has been done and the aftermath is unimaginable"], ["Can you tell me why not?"], ["You should still take it though. What done is done, the new vaccine will help situation not getting worse"], ["I thin it's rushed because people trying to push it so they voided some troublesome paperwork stage"], ["Frontliners will get it first, you don't have to worry too much about the vaccine"], ["Then you should be relieved since the sooner they  get the vaccine, the less worry for your family"], ["It's ok to feel doubtful about it, you can keep wearing mask and social distancing and take the vaccine when you feel ready"], ["We need to put an end to this and vaccine is the fastest way. It's gonna take very long to find treatment"], ["So you are concerned that you are feeling unmotivated and don't feel like doing anything."], ["Have you felt like this for a while or has it only been a recent change in your feelings and motivation?"], ["That must be a real challenge and if it is a recent change it is natural to feel concerned about this."], ["I do not always feel positive and motivated myself and have spoken to a professional in the past which helped me understand why this is, for me it was linked to a lack of sleep."], ["People's moods can be regulated by many things. I know for example that sleep and diet can play a big part in some cases."], ["have you tried talking to your friends and telling them now you feel? They may not know you are feeling this may and might be able to help you and provide support."], ["What is it about opening up that you find difficult? is it sharing your feelings with others?"], ["I think you have reached out for support and so you clearly want to do something about this which is a great first step. I think you can get over these fears and overcome them."], ["I can tell you are anxious about it and fear coming across as weak but I think that would be a positive step for you."], ["I think you can do it and overcome this issue!"], ["You are welcome"], ["Thanks for talking it through"], ["What kind of issues do you think you are having?"], ["I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today."], ["Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is \"bad news\"?"], ["The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys."], ["Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her?"], ["You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys?"], ["Perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact. For example, if money is the problem for your parents, you can set some rules. LIke you can set an allowance for how much money you can use each week."], ["If you want a better communication, I believe in person will be best."], ["I apologize and I do agree it is sometimes difficult. Perhaps it will be better to talk to them with another  person present."], ["If another person is present, it may make it easier. However, I believe it should be someone that is not invovled in this issue. Perhaps another family member or a close family friend."], ["Parents have a difficult time understanding their child at times. Hopefully, through this you all can become closer."], ["I personally understand how difficult this can be. But if this works out. You can have a good family relationship and maintain a good relationship with your girlfriend."], ["Best of luck!"], ["Sorry to hear you're upset. Want to share why you're feeling that way?"], ["Do you feel like you can't take any actions in the situation?"], ["That sounds frustrating, especially if you're one of the employees affected and when the new boss doesn't seem to know what he/she is doing with the reorganization."], ["That's positive, though, that you at least have a strategy in mind with retirement, even if this may not be the best time right now."], ["It sounds like you are not the only worker who is seriously questioning the changes being made."], ["Wow! From what you've said, it sounds like your coworkers feel much as you do about the changes."], ["That must be tough, but it must help to at least commiserate through the phone calls and be able to relate to each other."], ["My former spouse works for a company that has moved him to departments he needed to retrain to work in, and he is considering looking for a different job, maybe after COVID is outta here."], ["It sounds like you're determined to stay as positive as possible while considering other options, such as a new job. Doing something about it like this must feel a little better."], ["You're welcome! I also think that's wise to hold off on retirement until your daughter is through college. My oldest is ready for college and I don't feel ready to leave work, either."], ["You can do it!"], ["You too! G'night."], ["That is not good. Is this a new thing or has it always been this way?"], ["Have you ever tried to get any help for it?"], ["That's  shame. Not all doctors are understanding. Are you able to see someone else?"], ["What about over the counter stuff? Have you considered that?"], ["I personally have found some very useful herbal remedies."], ["Ah I was going to  ask if you thought that some trauma had started this, Do you want to talk about it?"], ["That sounds very traumatic. Have you ever talked with anyone about it before?"], ["Well that is not very helpful of them! Clearly you are not able to move on or you would not be having disturbed sleep"], ["I hope these were not paid specialists you were seeing"], ["Are you there?"], ["You went very quiet! What else would you like to talk about?"], ["I am sorry to hear that, I did not mean to upset you further. Anyway I hope you can get some adequate help in the future. Anyway, I wish you all the best!"], ["Can you press quit and take the survey? I can't do it my end :)"], ["can you press quit and take the survey? :)"], ["hello? :)"], ["I am well. Anything I can help with today?"], ["I understand it has een stressful for you  during lockdown unemployed, that must feel frustrating."], ["Is there anyone in your imediate household you can confide in with your feelings?"], ["I compleyely understand I have also lost my career due to covid. Dont give up, staying positive and open minded to new opportunities will help you find work."], ["i see.i would call the companies themselves and see if they have programs in place to help you."], ["At least they might give extensions."], ["Also there are people willing to help sometimes in local places. An extension would happen when the institution you owe gives you more time to pay them."], ["I would try going to the town hall."], ["Going to the town hall means phsyically going to your local town hall asking for help for assistance. There should within have programs you can apply for."], ["Once again I a, sorry to hear that you are depressed. Make sure to go ouside everyday. I have learned that healthy doses of sunshine help.\nYes I have often felt helpless due this pandemic."], ["I will say though that exercise, movies and lots of coffee have helped me."], ["Yes i normally use netflix."], ["prime i do no use so much"], ["Did  this conversation make you feel any less depressed?"], ["No i can usuallly find something new to watch."], ["Are you a real person or a computer program?"], ["Some other ways are staying as involed with anything I can, like reading, writing, or drawing."], ["Yes i am real and doing this task for amazon mechanical turk, are you as well?"], ["Although I do genuinelly care for helping others feel ettter."], ["Are you waiting for me to end this to get the higher exrra payment at the end?"], ["well i will end and say goodye i hope you get through this. i know you will"], ["HELLO"], ["going good what about you"], ["how was your day"], ["it sounds good"], ["Don't worry my friend there will be peaks and downs in life same in exam too prepare hard for your next exam surely you ll shine"], ["do u attend your classes regularly?"], ["That's great. Did u love your studies?"], ["That's a good idea. Even I had this problem during my studies"], ["Then my friend suggested me to study at early morning rather than evening and nights."], ["that's great"], ["Try to have a water bottle behind u when u study and try to concentrate more and its best to choose a peaceful place to study."], ["you seems to be a bright student. hope you will crack your exams with high score"], ["Hello! How are you doing today?"], ["Not bad for a Monday, but that's often a bummer of a day. What's got you down?"], ["Ah, that can be awkward. Are you happy about the new position?"], ["So do you think you are feeling down more because of missing your friends or your nervousness about the new job?"], ["That only makes things tougher, doesn't it. So is there a way you could reassure your co-workers that this new position doesn't mean you have left their lives?"], ["What kinds of things do you think might help with that?"], ["Could you meet for lunch or coffee now and then?"], ["Or could you all create a standing \"group chat\" to touch base regularly?"], ["Cool! But I gather that if you already do that, you don't think that would be enough? Or would it? What else might work?"], ["Ah, so you think that being on different shifts may be what has you all concerned about losing touch?"], ["Is there some overlap between the end of your day shift and the beginning of their night shift? Is there a time you are all awake? Maybe dinner for you, but \"breakfast\" for them?"], ["What else might minimize the separation? Do you all have weekends off?"], ["So maybe the \"between shifts\" type meeting may help? It might be hard to schedule, but I think you can do that. What do you think?"], ["So, if the \"gang\" can stay together, what's got you nervous about the new position?"], ["Hi, do have any issues that you would like to share with me today?"], ["I am sorry to hear that. So, you and your friends are not seeing eye to eye? Do you mind telling me what the issue is that yo are not agreeing on?"], ["That can be difficult and I can relate to that too. When friends do not respond the way that we feel that they should it can be really hard. Do you have any family that you are close with?"], ["I understand the issue of money can cause a lot of problems in a relationship. I had a best friend borrow money once and it lead to her never paying it back and we stopped being friends. Do you plan on trying to talk to your friends soon? Maybe I can give you some advice on how to approach them."], ["Maybe you could chose a place to meet that is neutral, somewhere at a park or at a cafe. You can ask them to reflect on the good memories in your friendship and then express how you value them as people and friends. Does that sound like something you can try?"], ["That is a good idea too. Having boundaries is the healthiest part of a relationship so that neither party gets taken advantage of. Setting up lines not to cross is a great idea."], ["I understand that friends can disappoint us sometimes and friendships can take a lot of effort. I would recommend starting a journal. A daily journal can help you express your feelings on paper and it can help you from getting to frustrated and keeping your feelings inside."], ["I am proud of you today because you reached out and have tried to find help outside of yourself. You are growing and trying to do your best."], ["Yes, you're growing and trying to do your best and wanting to expand your boundaries and make them clear. You have taken the right approach and are on the best track to having a successful relationship in the future. Great Job! Thank you for sharing your story with me today."], ["You are welcome and here for you anytime. I am able to listen and do my best to help you navigate friendships and other issues too. We are always here."]]
