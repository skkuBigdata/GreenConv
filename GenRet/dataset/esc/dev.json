I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse. EOS Since lockdown  haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available? EOS What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest. EOS I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. EOS I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues? EOS That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It's good that it's recognised these days at least. EOS", 9048], ["once i feel very happy when he was with me.

Yeah it's tough especially with rising cases for the past two weeks or so in my city. EOS I live in Canada and my city is pretty good so far and really low on numbers but have been seeing new cases every day for the last two weeks or so EOS so that adds anxiety to me when I go out and I am more on guard and paranoid EOS And we had a lock-down earlier this year and yet, with the exception of one province, every province remains operational at full speed despite lock-downs earlier, and now a lot of provinces are seeing record cases with the second wave. EOS yeah I hope you get through this okay also and stay safe and well. EOS I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time. EOS And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March. EOS yeah I have been adjusting to it and the cases were down and even to zero in my city for most of the last few months, but there's definitely the start of a new community spread now. EOS yes correct EOS Plus there's a loss of routine or motivation. I procrastinate a lot and get lost in thought or lost without thought. I don't work out as much as I used to (inside or outside of home). I don't eat as well and my sleep pattern is not good at all (I sleep a lot later than I should). EOS So I am disappointed in myself to say the least. EOS and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive EOS now I am more used to it of course, but this summarizes how I have been feeling for most of this year. EOS yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but I didn't want to gamble and compromise. And I still see those people as selfish when I choose to do what I think is right. EOS yeah no worries. It's good that you understand and thank you for listening. EOS We won't know more about the mental implications and the sociological aspects of the pandemic probably until years to come. EOS I thought about that EOS to the gym, I certainly would. Because it's indoors and I do feel it's unsafe as there are many equipment that others could touch. Running I felt that way because the path that I usually run on is narrow and other people walk through it also. However, I did have second thoughts about that when the case numbers were down. But I finally decided to keep doing it and stick to all outdoor trips for essential business. EOS but that's just me, and I know we all have different personalities, preferences, and tolerances of risks and acceptances, etc. EOS so in my opinion, I feel a little indignant at the people that have been going out frivolously like there's nothing going on, to even gamble their safety and their family's. Like I live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety. So I just didn't feel it was fair for them to do that when I could have done that anytime I wanted. EOS black and white thinking...let me think EOS for this pandemic, it's pretty much black and white EOS Because I either go out or I don't. I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right. Because if I had done that, I would have done that already, and long ago. And even though it's really hard on me. EOS yeah exactly. Because people are being selfish and are subjecting others to risks even if they don't care about themselves. EOS but I know I am pretty extreme in my thinking. EOS I really love the outdoors and I go out pretty often before the pandemic. EOS But it's just that my own thinking is rigid and made up about it. EOS But anyhow, that's the situation in a nutshell. EOS yeah I understand your thinking with the grey areas as well. I suppose for this case, it's all black and white for me, no grea areas or compromises. EOS that's good analysis by the way. EOS But anyhow I am good to go then. Thank you so very much for understanding and for your valuable inputs. EOS it's a fascinating area though, fascinating thinking. I am also curious on the social and mental implications of this in the long-run EOS but only time will tell EOS there will be so much research and books written about our times. EOS well I do a lot of \"waste\" at home. So I am quite sluggish and lazy and lost at home. EOS I am productive but not as driven or productive as before at home. EOS for sure yeah. I am sure we can get through all this in one piece eventually. EOS I was thinking this also that even though this is a very tough time, we will look back on this about years from now, and say wow, we got through all that!

Yeah it's tough especially with rising cases for the past two weeks or so in my city. EOS I live in Canada and my city is pretty good so far and really low on numbers but have been seeing new cases every day for the last two weeks or so EOS so that adds anxiety to me when I go out and I am more on guard and paranoid EOS And we had a lock-down earlier this year and yet, with the exception of one province, every province remains operational at full speed despite lock-downs earlier, and now a lot of provinces are seeing record cases with the second wave. EOS yeah I hope you get through this okay also and stay safe and well. EOS I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time. EOS And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March. EOS yeah I have been adjusting to it and the cases were down and even to zero in my city for most of the last few months, but there's definitely the start of a new community spread now. EOS yes correct EOS Plus there's a loss of routine or motivation. I procrastinate a lot and get lost in thought or lost without thought. I don't work out as much as I used to (inside or outside of home). I don't eat as well and my sleep pattern is not good at all (I sleep a lot later than I should). EOS So I am disappointed in myself to say the least. EOS and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive EOS now I am more used to it of course, but this summarizes how I have been feeling for most of this year. EOS yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but I didn't want to gamble and compromise. And I still see those people as selfish when I choose to do what I think is right. EOS yeah no worries. It's good that you understand and thank you for listening. EOS We won't know more about the mental implications and the sociological aspects of the pandemic probably until years to come. EOS I thought about that EOS to the gym, I certainly would. Because it's indoors and I do feel it's unsafe as there are many equipment that others could touch. Running I felt that way because the path that I usually run on is narrow and other people walk through it also. However, I did have second thoughts about that when the case numbers were down. But I finally decided to keep doing it and stick to all outdoor trips for essential business. EOS but that's just me, and I know we all have different personalities, preferences, and tolerances of risks and acceptances, etc. EOS so in my opinion, I feel a little indignant at the people that have been going out frivolously like there's nothing going on, to even gamble their safety and their family's. Like I live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety. So I just didn't feel it was fair for them to do that when I could have done that anytime I wanted. EOS black and white thinking...let me think EOS for this pandemic, it's pretty much black and white EOS Because I either go out or I don't. I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right. Because if I had done that, I would have done that already, and long ago. And even though it's really hard on me. EOS yeah exactly. Because people are being selfish and are subjecting others to risks even if they don't care about themselves. EOS but I know I am pretty extreme in my thinking. EOS I really love the outdoors and I go out pretty often before the pandemic. EOS But it's just that my own thinking is rigid and made up about it. EOS But anyhow, that's the situation in a nutshell. EOS yeah I understand your thinking with the grey areas as well. I suppose for this case, it's all black and white for me, no grea areas or compromises. EOS that's good analysis by the way.

He's great, but it's just not the same as having a friend to turn to.  I feel every time I reach out to the friends I do have they are too busy with their families to talk. EOS Yea, I do comment on their social media and follow up with their lives there.  I do not actively post about my own life because we have been extremely cautious with covid as I am high risk, so we don't even go grocery shopping.

I am definitely looking forward to spring, which is quickly approaching now!  I have to say, I appreciate you pushing me in the direction of thinking positively and looking forward to the future, it's something I definitely lost my grasp on for a little while. EOS You're definitely right I have a lot to be excited about.  I like the idea of setting goals each day.  Now that the weather is slightly nicer I think going for a daily walk is a good idea.  Also, definitely preparing for puppy and getting an area set up and arranged for him is a great idea.  I find myself mindlessly scrolling the internet many days so reading a book is also a great idea. EOS That's a good point, maybe an e-mail as that is something they may check when they have some down time, where as when I text I feel a lot of times they look at it and are busy and then forget to respond.  But if they sit down and are checking their emails maybe they will have time for a quick response.

EOS like it was only this tuesday when my city finally acknowledge there's community spread and second wave, when it has been happening slowly for the last two weeks! EOS it's irresponsible and they share information slowly to the public and don't disclose enough information. And they are still not shutting down gyms or restaurants, when they are the main sources right now in my city. EOS yeah I have been doing all that, with the washing of the hands and so forth. The situation at my job is unavoidable but I am still as careful as I try to cope. EOS well, it's only today they brought the limit to social gatherings from 10 to 5. EOS too slow and they don't believe in shutting down essential businesses when that will stop it once and for all after two or three weeks. They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick. And today they openly said that unless deemed necessary, they will only shut down \nselective places because restaurants need to stay open for business, etc. EOS yeah there's a local line but it's a pretty big city and it wouldn't really matter what I say EOS but anyhow, I have been conferring with my friend pretty much daily on the phone and that does help with social support.

EOS okay yeah good idea. EOS I can look for more videos too on such resources EOS like I don't play any musical instruments but that would be great for a distraction like that or to pass time or to improve on a craft or project. EOS Just pretty much my studies with two online courses and not even reading anything outside of school. And even then, my school work ethics suck and I am kind of disappointed at my lapses that way.

EOS there was a project he wanted to do and it bothered him that it had not gotten done.  Well, I was able to do it, because he had taught me enough to know what to do.

EOS But the last time I was told I could not sign for the church, I told the elder who said no that God was going to give him a sign. EOS Well, God delivered on the promise quickly.

Yeah it's tough especially with rising cases for the past two weeks or so in my city. EOS I live in Canada and my city is pretty good so far and really low on numbers but have been seeing new cases every day for the last two weeks or so EOS so that adds anxiety to me when I go out and I am more on guard and paranoid EOS And we had a lock-down earlier this year and yet, with the exception of one province, every province remains operational at full speed despite lock-downs earlier, and now a lot of provinces are seeing record cases with the second wave. EOS yeah I hope you get through this okay also and stay safe and well. EOS I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time. EOS And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March. EOS yeah I have been adjusting to it and the cases were down and even to zero in my city for most of the last few months, but there's definitely the start of a new community spread now. EOS yes correct EOS Plus there's a loss of routine or motivation. I procrastinate a lot and get lost in thought or lost without thought. I don't work out as much as I used to (inside or outside of home). I don't eat as well and my sleep pattern is not good at all (I sleep a lot later than I should). EOS So I am disappointed in myself to say the least. EOS and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive EOS now I am more used to it of course, but this summarizes how I have been feeling for most of this year. EOS yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but I didn't want to gamble and compromise. And I still see those people as selfish when I choose to do what I think is right. EOS yeah no worries. It's good that you understand and thank you for listening. EOS We won't know more about the mental implications and the sociological aspects of the pandemic probably until years to come. EOS I thought about that EOS to the gym, I certainly would. Because it's indoors and I do feel it's unsafe as there are many equipment that others could touch. Running I felt that way because the path that I usually run on is narrow and other people walk through it also. However, I did have second thoughts about that when the case numbers were down. But I finally decided to keep doing it and stick to all outdoor trips for essential business. EOS but that's just me, and I know we all have different personalities, preferences, and tolerances of risks and acceptances, etc. EOS so in my opinion, I feel a little indignant at the people that have been going out frivolously like there's nothing going on, to even gamble their safety and their family's. Like I live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety. So I just didn't feel it was fair for them to do that when I could have done that anytime I wanted. EOS black and white thinking...let me think EOS for this pandemic, it's pretty much black and white EOS Because I either go out or I don't. I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right. Because if I had done that, I would have done that already, and long ago. And even though it's really hard on me. EOS yeah exactly. Because people are being selfish and are subjecting others to risks even if they don't care about themselves. EOS but I know I am pretty extreme in my thinking. EOS I really love the outdoors and I go out pretty often before the pandemic. EOS But it's just that my own thinking is rigid and made up about it. EOS But anyhow, that's the situation in a nutshell. EOS yeah I understand your thinking with the grey areas as well. I suppose for this case, it's all black and white for me, no grea areas or compromises. EOS that's good analysis by the way. EOS But anyhow I am good to go then. Thank you so very much for understanding and for your valuable inputs. EOS it's a fascinating area though, fascinating thinking. I am also curious on the social and mental implications of this in the long-run EOS but only time will tell EOS there will be so much research and books written about our times. EOS well I do a lot of \"waste\" at home. So I am quite sluggish and lazy and lost at home. EOS I am productive but not as driven or productive as before at home. EOS for sure yeah. I am sure we can get through all this in one piece eventually. EOS I was thinking this also that even though this is a very tough time, we will look back on this about years from now, and say wow, we got through all that! EOS no no I am okay thanks for asking EOS I am just kind of spelling in out the details of my thinking and how my life has been so far EOS I am actually okay\n so no worries EOS yup. Exactly. Lost time can always be made up later. EOS okay then. I am good to go. Thanks again and thank you for your input. It does help to just kind of vent in a way. EOS Yeah for sure EOS I worked out a little bit before I started the chat. I am also doing some online courses on my own time. So I will keep working hard on those.

I have heard nothing at all. EOS I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job:  it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination.  I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. EOS Working there would be ministry, not typical work.  And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS Thank you.  I believe there are three things in my favor:  I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current (related) job fifteen years ago. EOS We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/work partner?  I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families.  I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family. EOS The benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. EOS And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. EOS At the risk of preaching religion, I believe God may be calling me to serve there.

EOS even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don't know and it just boggles on my mind. EOS I get that there's a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren't any cases then, as the first w\nave was gone from my city EOS I see. Yeah I feel you definitely EOS like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don't think they should be doing that too much. EOS it is. And that's sad but true.

It's hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. I was more affected and more emotional.

I will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news EOS so yeah, just aimless and procrastinate often, and need more self-imposed structure, discipline, maturity, organization, time-management, etc. EOS yeah good idea EOS like I am only lately gaining ground and staying on track so I am improving on this EOS yeah I should be like that too, something like having an hour to look forward to towards the end as a reward of some sort.
